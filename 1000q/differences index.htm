<b><font size="4">Here are some differences between generations, models, and engines in
VW TDI .</font></b></p>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p>The TDI brand came to North American with the Mk3 (3rd generation) 1996
Passat TDI.&nbsp; The most noticeable differences were the electronically controlled
distributor injection pump (Bosch VE pump), turbocharging with intercooling, and a
new engine.&nbsp; The Mk4 and Mk5 generation of TDI each received improvements over
the last generation in safety, comfort, and features but became slightly more
mechanically complex.&nbsp; The mk6 use the same engines as the mk5 but in
revised chassis.&nbsp; The Golf and Jetta are also no longer built on the same
chassis.</p>
<p>The big difference in engines was the transition from direct
injection using the Bosch VE injection pump to the pumpe duse injection system
beginning in 2004 (for North America) and again to common rail in 2009.&nbsp; Below are links with more detailed information about
the cars including generational differences, model differences, and
interchangeable parts.&nbsp; At the bottom is information showing the difference
between the old direct injection, pumpe duse, and the new common rail fuel
injection.</p>
