<h1>How to increase power in a Audi or VW TDI engine: basic performance upgrades
</h1>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b>
</p>

<h2>This page discusses some of the basic performance upgrades for TDI engines
like a chip or a tune.</h2>

<p>It's easy to get more power out of a turbo diesel engine for a few reasons.&nbsp;
An engine is basically an air pump and the turbos on all modern diesel cars can increase the efficiency of this pump over OEM levels.  For more details on turbocharging systems and exhausts for turbos,
please read: <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q: turbocharging</a>.&nbsp; A diesel engine can
also run well in a wider range of air/fuel ratio (AF) compared to a gasoline
engine.&nbsp; A gasoline engine must stay in a small AF range to run well but by adding a little more fuel to your diesel engine it can safely get more power and still run well. This is done with chips or tuning boxes.</p>
<p> One you pass the point of diminishing returns with a chip you must upgrade other parts of the engine
like the intercooler, turbo, and piping,
and computer programming to
be able to efficiently burn more fuel.&nbsp; Too much fuel in a diesel will
result in some unburned fuel which goes out the exhaust as smoke.&nbsp; A little extra fuel from a chip
should only create a small puff of smoke but a chip and fuel injectors that are too
large for your setup might kill all the mosquitoes
in the neighborhood from the massive smoke screen!&nbsp; An acceptable level of smoke is highly subjective from owner to owner and even
varies from model to model.&nbsp; Excess smoke from unburned fuel is also
a sign that fuel is being wasted = lower fuel economy.</p>
<p>Upgrading the fuel system or chipping the car will only produce gains up to
a certain point.&nbsp; Overfueling will raise exhaust exhaust gas temperature (EGT).&nbsp;
Way too much fuel will cause damaging EGT and even more fuel could cause engine
meltdown!&nbsp; This is the opposite of a gasoline engine where
running a little rich may lower exhaust gas temperatures.</p>
<p> The basic
upgrades on this page will not significantly affect engine
reliability or lifespan if they are properly designed and used.&nbsp; See <a href="TDI-performance-mods-clutch-turbo.htm">1000q:
advanced and extreme performance upgrades</a> for advanced performance upgrades such as
intercoolers and upgraded turbos.&nbsp; Some performance upgrades
may cause the clutch to slip.&nbsp; Before you do any power mods, make sure your
car is in good running condition and all maintenance is up to date!
<p>Some
people complain about TDIs are very slow or that their TDI feels slower than it
when it was new.&nbsp; If this is the case, read <a href="multi/low-power-fix-TDI.htm">1000q:
constant low power or can't rev</a> and <a href="multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">1000q:
limp mode solutions</a> because there is probably a sensor or other problem
causing low power or power cutting out. Your car must be in good shape before adding power mods because adding power won't mask  existing problems.<br>

<h3>Chip and software upgrades for the VW TDI or Audi TDI engine</h3>
<p>The first recommended modification would be a chip tune.  This is a
modification to the stock programs on the car's computer.&nbsp; Some older VW TDI required soldering a physical chip to the car's computer, the ECU/ECM. All newer TDI don't require soldering as the modification is done to the programming.</p>
<p>For a daily driver, this is an excellent first step since it preserves
and improves stock drivability and won't significantly reduce fuel
economy as long as you don't have a lead foot!&nbsp; I do not recommend chips
for nonturbo or nonsupercharged or non diesel cars because the cost benefit ratio isn't there. You could pay hundreds of dollars and only recive a small power increase, often only noticeable at high rpm near redline.&nbsp; With a turbo or supercharged car chip you
could gain 20-50 peak horsepower (depending on the car) with a much better power curve 
due to the properties of turbocharging and diesels.&nbsp; Some chip vendors for the TDI will
also reflash/upgrade their chip software for the original owner for free or at a discount so
that as your modifications change you don't have to worry as much about the cost of
adjusting the  software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some chip tuners who specalize on TDI engines are <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/the--dsh--dsh-PERFORMANCE-PARTS-dsh--cln-CHIP-TUNING-and-ECU-UPGRADES-cln-TDI/Categories" target="_blank">KermaTDI</a> and <a href="http://www.malonetuning.com" target="_blank">Malone Tuning</a><a href="http://www.oettinger.de/index2_e.htm"></a>.&nbsp;
They also do chip tuning for the neweset CRD 2.0L TDI engines 2009 and newer models.</p>
<h4>Why you can't just raise the boost</h4>
<p>If you're new to turbo car tuning, you may have heard that you can get more
power just by turning up the boost.&nbsp; More boost (air) only equals more power if fuel is
also increased.&nbsp; In some gasoline cars, the fuel maps or injectors, etc.,
may not support increased boost.&nbsp; You must do research on each different gasoline or diesel car before modifying since turning up the boost can
cause engine damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> In the TDI, the car's computer
controlled fueling will not increase fueling solely in response to increased
boost.&nbsp; Unlike most gasoline turbo car's open loop/closed loop control, all
but 2009 and newer TDI are closed loop controlled fueling only.&nbsp; There is no o2 sensor to meter fueling and
after the injection pump - there is no further metering of fuel by the car's computer.&nbsp;
(2009 and newer TDI use a new emissions control system which
does effect fueling.)&nbsp; With a diesel, you
should be thinking about adding more fuel and adding enough air to control
smoke, keep EGT down, etc.</p>
<h4>2009+ Jetta, Golf, and Audi A3 TDI chip tuning</h4>
<p> These engine all use the <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">2.0L CBEA-CJAA engine</a>. Chip tuning has been tested on these models with great results. While high altitude, build variation, and dyno variables will cause small variations in actual and measured power, your average engine will make about 170 hp and 320 lb-ft torque after a chip flash.</p>
<p>The big difference
  vs. 2006 and earlier TDI is the diesel particulate filter.&nbsp; See <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
    DPF FAQ for VW and Audi</a> for more details on this system. If you have a <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">DSG transmission</a> it can limit the torque from a chip tune. For best results, a DSG transmission software flash will raise these limits. It's also possible to remove the DPF system with a TDI engine DPF delete tune from <a href="http://www.malonetuning.com" target="_blank">Malone Tuning</a>. Note: always comply with all emissions laws where you live/operate the car.</p>
<p>They do not yet have larger fuel injectors available.</p>
<h4>2006+ VW Touareg TDI and Audi Q7 TDI chip tune</h4>
<p>The 2006-2008 VW Touareg TDI used a V10 with 550 lb-ft of torque. The engine's weak spots are the turbos and  the transmission is the next weak spot if you raise power levels. There are chip tunes out there if you wish to proceed. The 2009+ VW Touareg TDI and Audi Q7 TDI use a V6 engine that is much more robust with more room to increase power. They also feature a DPF system but since they use Adblue diesel exhaust fluid, see <a href="vw-touareg-tdi-dpf-audi-q7.htm">1000q: DPF-Adblue FAQ</a> for more on their systems.</p>
<h4>Fuel injectors or nozzles</h4>
<p>
Older VW TDI respond very well to larger fuel injectors or nozzles as a basic fuel upgrade. This delivers more fuel to
the engine without changing the car's computer.&nbsp; Unlike  gasoline cars which require a narrow AF
ratio, diesel engines are variable ratio
engines and running rich will produce more power.&nbsp; One advantage of
changing fuel injectors vs. a chip is that it also increases the amount of fuel to the
engine and maintains stock drivability.&nbsp; Another advantage is that all fuel
injector nozzles will wear out over time so upgrading the fuel injectors/nozzles
may prove to be a good value alternative to buying new nozzles in the same
size.&nbsp; For detailed fuel
injector information and technical details, see <a href="multi/TDI-nozzle-FAQ.htm">1000q:
fuel injector and nozzle TDI FAQ</a>.&nbsp; For the updated detailed
installation procedure, see <a href="multi/nozzle-install-TDI.htm">1000q:
fuel injector / nozzle install</a>.</p>
<p><b>For 1996-2006 VW TDI:&nbsp;</b> You can use a VCDS tool by Ross Tech  to change the
  ECU &quot;adaptation&quot; and fine tune fueling to
  reduce smoke and make very small changes to fuel consumption.&nbsp; Note: the automatic and manual transmission VW diesels have
  different sized fuel injectors and injection pumps!&nbsp; The automatic
  transmission uses smaller nozzles but a larger injection pump.&nbsp; Putting a
  larger injection pump on a manual transmission car is like putting larger
  nozzles on an automatic transmission car because they both increase
  fueling.&nbsp; More information is in the fuel injector FAQ linked in the above
paragraph.</p>
<p>The newest nozzle designs use a diamond like coating (DLC) to increase durability and service life vs. the older nozzles with the use of ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD) that is now sold in Europe and North America.</p>
<p><b>.184 injector</b>s: stock on 90hp North American manual transmission diesels.
This would be a mild upgrade for automatic transmission cars, although
recalibrating with a VAG-COM is recommended for automatic cars because they have
a larger injection pump, this will adjust smoke.</p>
<p><b>.205 injectors</b>:&nbsp; stock on 110hp European manual diesels.&nbsp; Keep in
mind that they also had a larger turbo and different ECU to supply more air to
burn more fuel.&nbsp; Note that power gains from switching from .184 to .205
will be less than .184 injectors with a chip.&nbsp; For most car setups, this is
a good choice. </p>
<p><b>.216 injectors</b>:&nbsp; stock on the 150hp 5 cylinder VW t4 diesel vans.&nbsp;
It is not recommended since a chip with .184 or .205 injectors would be more efficient
at raising power safely, although it can be done.&nbsp; When combined with a
chip, you should be adding larger turbos, intercooler, exhaust, and fueling
supporting mods.&nbsp; See <a href="TDI-performance-mods-clutch-turbo.htm">Extreme
power modifications</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The picture shows the location of the fuel injectors on a VW diesel (non
pumpe duse) circled
in blue.&nbsp; Cars with pumpe duse have the injectors located inside of the
valve cover so it's harder to swap them out.<br>
<img src="../images/fuelinj.jpg" alt="" width="799" height="380" border="0"></p>
<p><b>For 2005-2006 pumpe duse VW TDI injectors:</b>&nbsp; replacement is slightly harder than earlier cars because they're underneath the valve cover and are replaced as whole units.&nbsp; If you have a pumpe duse, I would
recommend getting a chip and seeing how you like it first before swapping
injectors.&nbsp; You can always add injectors later and have the chip updated for the new injectors. If you still want
injectors, kermatdi at <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/StoreFront">http://www.kermatdi.com/</a>
sells larger pumpe duse injectors.&nbsp; If you don't know if you have a pumpe
duse, all VW diesels in North America model years 2004-2006 are pumpe duse.&nbsp; For more
details, see <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">1000q: pumpe duse description.</a>&nbsp; Since pumpe duse engines came with more
power than earlier cars, getting a chip will give you more power than earlier
cars that only have a mild chip and nozzles.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of PD fuel injectors. The injector rockers and fuel injector block bolts have to be removed.<br>
  <img src="../images/misc/cam/cam3.jpg" width="797" height="400">
<h4>Chip + fuel injectors</h4>
<p>Using both an aftermarket chip and fuel injectors will also produce more
power than one modification alone.&nbsp; However, since the ECU doesn't know if
you have larger injectors or not, make sure you get a chip that is written for
larger injectors.&nbsp; Otherwise you will have unnecessary levels of
smoke and lower economy which a chip can adjust.&nbsp; Because of the higher power
levels, your clutch could start to slip due to the higher torque.&nbsp; Turning off the
<a href="egr-system-clogging-TDI.htm"> EGR</a> with VCDS is not recommended since it could set off a
check engine light and the ECU may adapt which results in lower fuel economy.</p>
<p>If you have an automatic, keep in mind that they have a larger injection pump
than manual cars so if you are using larger nozzles with a chip, the suggested upgrade is
to use injectors that are 1
size larger: .184.&nbsp; Any larger than .184 with an automatic transmission and you
could get smoke. .205 is the suggested maximum size you can use with a chip in manual
transmission with no other supporting modifications.&nbsp; Again, each car, each
software tune,
each driver, and their tolerance for smoke is slightly different.&nbsp; Other mods may increase or decrease the
amount of smoke and power you see.&nbsp; Clutch slip is more likely with chip +
nozzles since using them together
makes more power and torque.&nbsp; As a conservative recommendation, the mk4 TDI
should use smaller nozzles and a light tune or only a chip or only nozzles to
prevent clutch slip. Mk3 and Mk5 cars seem to be have stronger clutches.</p>
<h4>Fueling limitations</h4>
<p>Keep in mind that delivering extra fuel at the engine must be supported by
extra fuel flow in the whole system.&nbsp; The fuel filter must be unclogged,
the injection pump must be able to supply a sufficient amount of fuel.&nbsp; The
automatic transmission VW diesels had a 11mm injection pump, the manual
transmission had a 10mm injection pump.&nbsp; Basically, the maximum amount of
fuel that the smaller manual injection pump made was offset by using larger fuel
injectors.&nbsp; The diesel long block, the main engine itself, is the same in auto
and manual transmission cars, but the auxiliary parts such as the flywheel, the
injection pump, etc., are different.&nbsp; As a result, if you require a lot
more fuel than what the injection pump can mechanically deliver, the ECU will
sense a fault and can go into a safety mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>1996-2003 TDI did not have any electric fuel pump because the injection pump sucked fuel from the fuel tank.&nbsp; Adding a &quot;lift pump&quot; from a 2004+ TDI, a low pressure in-tank
electric fuel pump, will boost fuel pressure to the injection pump and
support higher power levels at higher rpms.&nbsp; In the above picture, the injection pump is the rectangular metal pump below
the left two fuel injectors. </p>
<h4>Air limitations</h4>
<p>Remember, adding more fuel must be accompanied by more air, otherwise you are
just over fueling the engine, creating smoke, and unnecessarily raising the exhaust gas
temperatures.&nbsp; Everything else being equal, you can't turn the boost up
beyond safe limits without raising temperatures and stressing the turbo.&nbsp; See <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q:
turbocharging</a> to understand more about turbocharging and read <a href="TDI-performance-mods-clutch-turbo.htm">1000q:
advanced performance modifications</a> for how to efficiently add more air.&nbsp;
Unlike many cars, an aftermarket oiled high flow air filter is not recommended for the TDI
because the mass air flow sensor (MAF) is failure prone, especially the
mk4 generation.&nbsp; There is a noticeable link between aftermarket high flow oiled
cotton air filters and MAF failure when used on a TDI.&nbsp; In addition, to
save parts and inventory costs, VW used the same air filter on most mk4 TDI and
the 240hp R32 Golf, and there is more than enough air filter capacity for all
generations of TDI.&nbsp; See <a href="multi/maf-faq-tdi.htm">1000q:
MAF faq</a> for more details on the MAF sensor. </p>
<h4>Advanced timing</h4>
<p>The way advanced timing will increase power is by injecting fuel later as the
engine piston is moving up and down.&nbsp; By adding fuel later in the stroke,
you create greater pressure and energy.&nbsp; Note that this also increases
stress and heat on the engine by a small amount.&nbsp; Fuel that is injected early has more time to burn and
produce energy than fuel that is injected late.&nbsp; As long as you stay within
the normal operating range of engine timing as found in your service manual,
advancing the timing may result in more power, easier starting, and better fuel
economy but hotter temperatures and engine stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that there is
an optimum point for timing.&nbsp; Anything other than this maximum point will
decrease power and mileage, but this is impossible to know since there are too
many variables involved.&nbsp; As long as you stay within the normal operating
range of engine timing, you are safe.&nbsp; Slightly advanced timing will also
result in easier cold starting.</p>
<p>Biodiesel also slightly advances the timing.&nbsp; It does not
change the mechanical timing because that is set by the injection pump and
ECU.&nbsp; Biodiesel should burn faster when injected because of the properties of biodiesel and higher
cetane which effectively advances the timing.</p>
<p>Also note that there are two different ways to advance timing:
physically adjusting the injection pump pulley or through VCDS adaptation.&nbsp;
If you
have an aftermarket chip, the chip maker has already adjusted the timing as necessary!</p>
<p>To adjust the injection pump timing, adjust the injection pump as shown in
(for mk3 cars: <a href="a3b4/vw-jetta-passat-tdi-timing-belt-replacement-install.htm">1000q:
timing belt part 2</a>) , OR (for mk4 ALH cars: <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f21/how-install-new-timing-belt-jetta-new-beetle-golf-alh-engine-1998-2003-a-2976/" target="_blank">1000q:
timing belt part 2</a>).&nbsp; These are exclusive articles so please join our
free community to view.&nbsp; Use a VCDS to make sure that you are staying within the normal operating boundaries
and adjust the pump as necessary.&nbsp; mk4 pumpe duse cars (2004+) do not have
mechanically adjustable injection timing.</p>
<h3>More advanced power upgrades</h3>
<p>You can still buy off the
shelf performance upgrades to further increase your power but past this point,
the value of dollar/horsepower in the upgrades is reduced and you may also
experience more reductions in fuel economy.&nbsp; The most common advanced performance
upgrade is a larger intercooler.&nbsp; However, only the VW Mk4 cars have off
the shelf
replacement intercoolers, so I have included this modification
in advanced performance modifications.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mk5 and newer cars use a front mount intercooler so it's difficult to add one much larger due to space limitations unless you change the bumper as well. Mk7 cars use an air-water intercooler integrated into the intake manifold and at this time, there aren't any off the shelf upgrade kits.</p>
<p>Beyond this
  point, the likelihood of clutch slipping is greatly increased.&nbsp; Mk4 cars
  may get clutch slip with just a chip, so remember that if you want more power
  you need more clutch clamping force!</p>
<p>Performance tires are also recommended to get the most power
to the ground.&nbsp; Sticky tires usually wear out faster and give less fuel
economy than harder non performance tires, so take this into account when
thinking about what your performance goals and intended use are.</p>
<p>Other advanced performance
upgrades would include custom exhaust components, upgraded turbo systems, or
custom made tuning chips.&nbsp; Keep in mind that one of the biggest advantages
of 4 cylinder diesels is that they have enough power to serve as daily drivers and deliver
nearly unbeatable fuel economy.&nbsp; The most common diesel
passenger cars, VWs, are not very good sports cars when compared to true sports
cars.&nbsp; They are light but the suspension setup is not that great, front wheel
drive isn't good for a sports car, and you are limited by tire width (because
suspension clearance of tires).&nbsp; None of these traits contribute to
making a very good sports car out of the box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A stock used corvette will
  always be a better sports car than a brand new TDI and for less money.&nbsp; A
  corvette doesn't have rear seats, but this article's focus is on power upgrades,
  not rear seating or fuel economy. In the end, the whole point of modifying your car is to
suit your taste and preferences, so if you want to upgrade
