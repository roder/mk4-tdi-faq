<h1>How to properly break in a new car engine with a focus on
the VW TDI and Audi TDI</h1>
<p><a href="../forum/index.php">Post a question in the Volkswagen TDI
forum</a></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>
There are many different opinions on how to break in an engine.&nbsp; This
article focuses on TDI engines.</h2>
<p>Some
people say to beat it hard, some people
say to keep turbo engine under boost to get the rings to seat, and some people
say to treat it how you intend to run it.&nbsp; My opinions on this page are the same general
advice
from automotive engineers and the owner's
manual.&nbsp; It's your engine
and your car, so like any other internet advice, take it with a grain of salt and
figure it out for yourself.</p>
<h3>&quot;Run it hard from hour 0&quot; is wrong - here's why</h3>
<p>The &quot;run it hard&quot; opinion hit a resurgence with a website from an air cooled motorcycle
mechanic.&nbsp; Aside from the page being focused on motorcycle engines, his
hard break in technique for the street only takes the bike up to 65 mph - that's
fast for a bike but not much for a car.&nbsp; Bikes are also thousands of pounds
lighter than cars so the engine doesn't have to work very hard if you're driving
&quot;normally&quot;.&nbsp; Some of the misunderstanding is that
one person's babying is another's beating.&nbsp; The advice also says that the
critical window of opportunity is only 20 miles or 9 dyno runs, then it becomes
200 miles for the street - which is it?&nbsp; It also says that power loss from
an easy break in could be up to 10% while the gain in power <u>as a result of
using his break in technique</u> could be up 10%.&nbsp; Call me a skeptic: car
makers have done full price + taxes buybacks when horsepower was 5% lower than
advertised (RX-8) and it's well known that many engines are underrated in their actual
power (335i N54).</p>
<p>The engine in your new car
really isn't a brand new engine either - it was already tested at the factory,
had its first oil change, driven on a dyno at the factory, on/off the transport,
and then around the dealership.&nbsp; In some cases the car was driven to
another dealer and test driven by other people.&nbsp; Some high performance cars are even driven hard on a track at the factory for
quality control.&nbsp; If the first minutes of engine break in determine the
rest of engine life and performance, you already missed it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Engine break in goals are proper heat cycling,
mating of parts, and stress reliving accomplished by incremental increases in
varying rpm and load.&nbsp; You definitely don't want to baby the engine but you
don't want to beat it hard either.&nbsp; The most important goals are avoiding excess engine wear, idling longer
than you normally would, steady rpm, and high load on a cold engine.&nbsp; Let's look at
the various parts of an engine and drivetrain to see how they are affected.</p>
<h3>A component by component examination of engine break in</h3>
<p><b>Clutch</b> - Everyone
will tell you that the clutch should be driven in moderate
stop and go conditions for the first 500 miles with no excessive slipping.&nbsp;
This transfers a layer of bedding material on the clutch, flywheel, and pressure
plate, and prevents glazing from excessive heat and slipping.&nbsp;
Holding a car on an incline using the clutch is really bad for the clutch and shouldn't
be done even after break
in.&nbsp; This wears the clutch disc for no reason and can contribute to excess
heat and &quot;hot spots&quot;.&nbsp; The outer diameter of a
clutch and flywheel disc travels more distance in one rotation than the inner
diameter (because it is farther from the center and travels in a larger circle),
and the
disc could, in extreme cases such as drag racing, promote warping and create an uneven friction surface.&nbsp;
See <a href="clutch-kit-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: clutch FAQ</a> for details on the TDI
clutch/flywheel.&nbsp; On a side note, aftermarket stronger clutch kits/pressure
plates could result in more crankshaft thrust bearing wear.&nbsp; Check the
above article for an explanation.</p>
<h4>Turbo seals and bearings</h4>
<p>The journal bearing
turbos in your TDI float on a layer
of pressurized oil.&nbsp; The turbo wheels can spin at speeds beyond 100,000 rpm
and although it's spinning pretty fast at engine idle, it's still slower than if
you're racing the engine.&nbsp; Early TDI
are conventional
fixed geometry and later/new TDI are variable vane turbos.&nbsp; See <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q: turbocharging for more
details</a>.</p>
<h4>Engine crankshaft and main bearings, cylinder head</h4>
<p>These are precision machined
and/or polished parts and
require no special break in other than stress relieving through heat cycling
associated with the rest of a normal engine break in (varying rpm/load, etc.)&nbsp;
Flat tappet lifters should be broken in by varying the engine rpm
around 2000-2500 rpm for a half hour but this really applies only to brand new engines with flat tappet
lifters.&nbsp; Your new car already had this done at the factory.&nbsp; This is
one reason to avoid excessive idling.</p>
<h4>Engine pistons and rings</h4>
<p>This is the major source of controversy.&nbsp;
First ask yourself how many correctly maintained and operated water cooled car
engines (excluding engines with known build quality issues) are replaced because
of
cylinder glazing and oil consumption because of poor engine break in?&nbsp; All TDI and many modern engines
also require synthetic oil.&nbsp; (Ever see oil sludge in a
VW/Audi? Not pretty!)&nbsp; If an oil sludge problem develops from not using
synthetic oil is it an engine design/build
problem, an engine break in problem, or an owner maintenance-oil change problem?</p>
<p>
During combustion, the pressures in the engine cylinder spike as the fuel burns.&nbsp; The
rings act as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_seal">labyrinth seal</a>
and seal the piston against the engine cylinder wall and scrape oil.&nbsp; In
general, diesel
engines see much higher pressures than gasoline engines.&nbsp; A diesel engine may see 2000 psi
peak combustion pressure vs. 1000-1700 psi for a gasoline engine.&nbsp; Engine pistons are not perfect round cylinders
when cold because they compensate and expand when warm.&nbsp; The pistons also
need to heat relax during break in.&nbsp; Before the engine
is warmed up or broken in, the pressures of combustion can push
past the piston rings more than a fully broken in and warmed up engine.&nbsp; This reduces engine
efficiency, power, and fuel mileage but will improve as the engine is
broken in and seals better.&nbsp; All engines
benefit from a normal warm up during normal operation. </p>
<p>From minute 0, the rings and freshly honed cylinder walls will scrape against
each other and begin break in by wearing into each other.&nbsp; Again, your
brand new car's engine was already run in at the factory.&nbsp; The friction of
the rings against the cylinder walls will also help heat cycle the rings.&nbsp;
A good break in would have incremental increases in heat cycling, load, and
rpm.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why you want to avoid moderate and high load/rpm operation at minute 0 on a cold engine is because this sudden increase generates excessive blow by and oil
glazing.&nbsp; It's normal for a light
coat of oil to be present on the cylinder walls, even more so during engine
break in.&nbsp; But excess heat generated by high rpm/load can cause this oil to
flash burn and glaze.&nbsp; Glazing can create generates hot spots where the rings
are not yet seated evenly.&nbsp; This glaze is very smooth and prevents proper
ring and cylinder break in.&nbsp; Excessive idling and consistently &quot;babying&quot; the engine
can create the
same problem. </p>
<p> Remember the section above where I
wrote &quot;the truth is somewhere in the middle&quot;?&nbsp; I believe that the
best engine
break in is a moderate break in - not hard but certainly not easy.&nbsp; This
means pushing the engine hard enough to seat the rings but not running it too
light or too hard and creating glazing.&nbsp; My suggestion is
to follow the owner's
manual written by the people who made your car. </p>
<p> In the end, remember that
anecdotal evidence or small sample sizes do not make a break in method right or
wrong.&nbsp; We would all like to believe that individuals hold some special
power over their cars that will result in a perfect break in and the best
car.&nbsp; The truth is that different cars of the same model will have some engine
and powertrain variation, even if everything else is equal.&nbsp; Some cars are
lemons from birth and some come off the assembly line in flawless condition.&nbsp; If you still believe in the &quot;hard break in&quot; method, read this MotorTrend
article which gets the
advice of multiple automotive engineers from Ford, Honda, and GM who discuss the
hard engine break in.&nbsp; If you read the popular mythbusting engine break in
site, some of the advice is for breaking in an engine on a dyno.&nbsp; On the
street it says to run your bike up to only 65 mph.&nbsp; Even if you follow his
advice I would bet many overdo it. </p>

<h3>New engine break in procedure (can really
apply to any modern water cooled  car engine)</h3>
<p><b>Differences between this and other popular engine break in advice</b>: my
suggestions on engine rpm are not so strict because it really depends on the
situation.&nbsp; It's hard to quantify power
as an exact RPM and load since each situation is slightly different.&nbsp;
Instead, I write estimated
rpm and % power.&nbsp; Terms like baby the engine, race, and normal driving mean different
things to different people so this article gives some rough suggestions.&nbsp;
Use your judgment to apply them depending on the situation.&nbsp; Exact mileages for
each break in step are also hard to quantify because 10 miles at redline, up a
hill, in stop and go driving, is not the same as 10 miles of highway break in.</p>
<p>For example, if you're going downhill in 3rd gear at 40 mph, the
engine has little load but higher rpm.&nbsp; This is a case of low %
power.&nbsp; But going back up the same hill in 3rd gear at 40 mph, the engine
will be at the same rpm but have higher load.&nbsp; Both these situations have different
accelerator pedal positions since a different amount of power is requested by
the driver.&nbsp; As a general rule during initial break in, medium rpm with medium load
is better than low rpm with high load since this can lug the engine which is bad
in general.&nbsp; Just remember that a little more or a little less
during engine break in isn't as important as long term maintenance on the long term health of the
engine.&nbsp; A little more or less during break in won't cause your engine to
blow up.</p>
<p>On a brand new engine (rebuilt or replaced engine), let the idle stabilize to
build oil pressure, etc..&nbsp; You should also be checking
coolant levels, adjusting idle, or checking other things on a new engine.&nbsp; Once the rebuilt engine
checks are complete, drive it with normal load, about 50-60% power until the engine is warm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a new car (remember, the engine was run at the factory) and once the
engine is warmed up, drive normally with up to 70% power (around 2500-3600 rpm on a VW TDI) during normal driving for the initial
break in.&nbsp; You won't kill the engine if you deviate from this so if conditions warrant higher rpm to avoid high load/low
rpm (like lugging the engine up a hill), go for
it.&nbsp; Don't
baby it but don't race it to redline either.&nbsp; As a rough guideline, when on a flat
road, keep the rpm moving up and down around
2000-2200 rpm on your TDI.&nbsp; Avoid extended idling.</p>
<p> After you've put some miles on it and once the engine is warm, rev it at
varying throttle up to about 75-80% with medium load while
driving in stop and go conditions.&nbsp; You want to avoid low rpm/high load
power settings (like lugging the engine) so don't be afraid to downshift.&nbsp;
Avoid steady rpm driving (like
highway) and excessive idling.&nbsp; The best thing
you can do is to drive up to 75-80% power and then coast down in gear under engine
braking (foot completely off the accelerator pedal) in smooth, gradual cycles.&nbsp; This heats up the engine and then lets it cool down.&nbsp;
Remember, there are oil spray jets in your turbodiesel (and most turbocharged
cars) that spray the underside of the engine pistons to cool them down.&nbsp;
Driving with moderate load and then letting it coast down in gear will heat
cycle the engine.&nbsp; This is much easier on a manual transmission car.</p>
<p>If it's a rebuilt engine,
change the oil at your discretion.&nbsp; A rough suggestion is after 1-2 miles and
again at 5-10 miles.&nbsp; If this is
a new car from the dealer, follow the recommended service/oil change in
your owner's manual.&nbsp; I do not suggest changing the engine oil at an
earlier mileage than the factory suggestion.&nbsp; Most engines already had
the first oil change at the factory.&nbsp; Remember, dealers are independently
operated so I suggest following the factory's suggestion, not the dealer's
suggestion.&nbsp;&nbsp;All new TDI use VW spec 507.00 engine oil so make sure the
dealer uses only VW 507.00 for warranty purposes.</p>
<p> Repeat the above for
the first 500 miles, gradually increasing the load/rpm cycles of the engine.&nbsp; Between
about 500-1000 miles, drive more normally.&nbsp; A brief, smooth, rpm
cycling to full power is fine after 1000 miles.&nbsp; Don't jam the accelerator
pedal but don't be afraid to press it all the way down either.&nbsp; You still want to avoid the use of cruise control or steady rpm
driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is a rebuilt engine, change the oil at your
discretion.</p>
<p> Once you exceed well over 1000 miles, you can drive normally after warm up.&nbsp; You
even want to rev it to redline under moderate load a few times to finish
relaxing and heat cycling the engine.&nbsp; This is not the &quot;hard break in&quot; method
that encourages high load and high revving from hour 0 (brand new engine).&nbsp; Always let
the engine warm up with low load driving before higher rpm operation.&nbsp; This is the difference between the &quot;hard&quot;
break in and proper break in: varying the rpm between low and high rpm and load on a warm
engine is not the same as the hard break in method of high load and rpm on a cold
engine - NEVER do that, even after engine break in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Avoid the use of
cruise control or steady rpm driving, although by this point it's not as
critical as from hour 0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you exceed 5000 miles, most of the initial break in has occurred.&nbsp;
Any engine oil
consumption should go down and fuel economy should slowly increase.&nbsp; You still want to vary
the speed when you can, but it's not as critical as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Past 10,000 miles, most of the engine break in has occurred on a diesel but your
compression, oil consumption, and fuel mileage may still improve slightly to 25,000-50,000 miles.&nbsp;
Engine oil analysis shows that even gasoline engines are
still slightly breaking in slightly at over 10,000 miles.&nbsp; From now on, avoid lugging the engine, try to
regularly drive at moderate power, and occasionally rev the engine under
sustained high load/rpm.&nbsp;
This helps to clear soot in the exhaust out of the turbo by raising exhaust gas temperatures
and burning the soot up and blowing it out,
especially for cars with VNT turbos.&nbsp; Even with a gasoline car, going to
occasional sustained high load/rpm will help burn up engine deposits.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p> Any
engine works best at its normal operating temperature so from now on, drive under
low-medium
power until it's warmed up.&nbsp; </p>

<h4>Final notes </h4>
<p>Engine lifespan and condition is more about consistency,
maintenance, and long
term habits (and engine build/design quality which is out of your control) than a secret technique that will give you some competitive
edge.&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence or small sample sizes do not make a break in
method right or wrong.&nbsp; People like to believe in a story or that
their car is special and in a way, it is special.&nbsp; Variations in engine
build tolerances, overall build quality, if the guy on the assembly line wasn't paying
attention, all make your car unique and produce variances in power, fuel
economy, and engine compression.&nbsp; Every car and every engine that comes off
the assembly line has some variance.&nbsp; If a secret engine break in technique
gave extra power, why don't hand built Corvette Z06 engines or Ferrari
engines get this treatment?&nbsp; Surely Ferrari can add it to the cost of a
$250,000 (before dealer markup) car!&nbsp; Every Nissan GTR is broken in on a
bench dynamometer for 44 minutes including up to redline.&nbsp; After the engine is in the car it's dyno tested
again and then driven hard  on a track by a factory test driver (where they also
do brake and transmission testing) so any &quot;hour 0&quot; break in
technique by the owner is moot.&nbsp; Does this mean a hard engine break in is
factory recommended for that car or that it doesn't make a difference over the
long term?&nbsp; If engine break in was the determining factor in car life,
wouldn't that make well beaten used rental cars the best cars ever?&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Even if you didn't follow the optimum
engine break in techniques, consistent engine warm up
and consistent maintenance contribute to a long engine life span.&nbsp;
Letting a 3 year old child have a soda won't contribute to obesity but giving them 2
liters of soda every day for life will.&nbsp; In the
end, almost all original owners of
passenger cars get rid of
the car before they need a new engine due to wear, so does it make a difference
anyways? </p>
