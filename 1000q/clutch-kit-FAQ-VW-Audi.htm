<br>
First, you need to figure out what the clutch will be used for and the estimated
torque it needs to hold.  The overwhelming majority of TDIs are used as
daily drivers.  The best clutch for this is a full faced street disk.&nbsp; In a
gas car, torque capacity
for the disk should be at least 10-20% greater than your target torque.&nbsp;
Unlike gas
cars, it's normal for a TDI to get large torque spikes so plan for
excess capacity. About 25% should contain any spikes and allow for tweaking your
setup in the future.&nbsp; Some aftermarket kits also rate their
clutch kits by the highest possible torque they've tested, some rate their
clutch kits by a more average sampling.&nbsp; Some rate flywheel and some
wheel torque.&nbsp; Make sure to ask your vendor specifics about the exact
clutch you are considering.</p>
<p>Also avoid mixing valeo and sachs g60 clutches
with the other's brand pressure plate (PP) since the height may be slightly different and is
designed to work with the same brand clutch/PP.&nbsp; Most clutch kits include
both the clutch and PP anyways.&nbsp; If putting a new clutch kit on your old DMF, sachs clutches won't fit luk DMF flywheels, etc. If using a valeo SMF clutch kit, their throwout bearing is also slightly thicker.</p>
<p>For a quick answer
  to what
  clutch upgrades are available for your car, see below.&nbsp; If your car has
  more than basic power mods, consult your parts vendor to see what
  other clutch kits there are.&nbsp; Below are more clutch/flywheel FAQ.</p>
<p>If changing a clutch and you have higher mileage, I also suggest a new clutch
fork/release arm, along with the normal clutch kit
components.&nbsp; You can also replace the pivot ball or fork spring but these seem to hold up
well in the TDI.&nbsp; The fork is inexpensive and sometimes
fails under normal use - replacement requires transmission removal.&nbsp;
Pictured below left is a VW TDI fork (it's supposed to be straight) and
another car's fork broken through normal use, below right.&nbsp; If you are putting in a much
stronger clutch/stiffer pressure plate or have high mileage, you should consider
replacing the fork with a new one.<br>

<p><b>Suggested torque specs</b>:&nbsp; If your clutch kit did not come with
torque specs, here are some suggested specs for the G60/vr6 kit.&nbsp; These
specs are superceded by any kit specific instructions.&nbsp; Medium strength
threadlocker is
suggested on the bolts and your new flywheel bolts should already have
threadlocker on them.&nbsp; *According to the Permatex blue medium strength
Loctite technical sheet, no adjustment in torque is needed.&nbsp; This is only
for this exact product, always check your specific threadlocker's technical
sheet for any adjustment torque when threadlocker is used.<br>
G60 flywheel: stage 1: 22 ft-lbs.&nbsp; stage 2: 44 ft-lbs.&nbsp; final stage:
additional 1/4 turn (90<sup>o</sup> turn)<br>
VR6 pressure plate: hand tight, then tighten diagonally in stages to a final
torque of 15 ft-lbs. (this keeps the pressure plate flat while tightening)</p>
<p><b>Mk3 VW TDI</b>, 1996-1997 passat, 1997-1999 jetta</p>
<p><u>Stock clutch&nbsp;</u> These cars came from the factory with a 228mm sachs clutch with a solid
flywheel.&nbsp; The clutch and pressure plate (and part number) is specific to the TDI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Stronger clutch kits</u> A basic upgrade would be the same sized 228mm TDI
clutch with a pressure
plate from a VW vr6 (6 cylinder gasoline engine).&nbsp; It
looks similar to your existing parts but they are not the same.&nbsp; It will bolt
directly to your existing flywheel and I suggest reusing the flywheel if it can
be reused.</p>
<p>If you are using the sachs clutch/pressure plate kit, the older suggestion
was to use the vr6 pressure plate with a vr6 clutch.&nbsp; When used with a vr6
clutch/vr6 pressure plate, it can hold about 330 ft-lbs torque.&nbsp; Some
report more driveline chatter in neutral.&nbsp; The sound is most noticeable
when at a drive through.&nbsp; If you are not heavily modified, the current
suggestion is to use the sachs TDI kit because it uses the vr6 pressure plate
with a different, TDI specific clutch to reduce driveline chatter.&nbsp; This is
the TDI/g60 kit from sachs.&nbsp; The stronger pressure plate gives more
clamping force and the clutch disk is the same size.&nbsp; The coefficient of
friction of the clutch should be about the same.</p>
<p>Clutch pedal weight will be
slightly less than stock versus the stock pressure plate, read the full FAQ article for more
details.</p>
<p>The 1990-1992 VW Corrado G60 solid flywheel will fit all model years
and will also bolt up to the vr6 clutch kit.&nbsp; Note: you can
use the vr6 clutch but cannot use the vr6 flywheel because 6 cylinder engines
use a different
bolt pattern.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also clutch kits that use longer clutch hub springs that
help smooth NVH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Mk4 VW TDI</b>, 1998-2005 new beetle, 1999.5-2003 jetta, 1999-2006 golf<br>
<br>
<u>Stock clutch</u><b> </b>ALH engine TDI came with 2 different clutches, both are solid hub and used with
a DMF<br>
  1998-2000 cars used a 220mm Luk clutch, stock PP is VW# 028 141 025 p,
clutch is # 028 141 036 L<br>
 2000-2003 cars used a 228mm Sachs clutch, stock
PP is # 038 141 025 d, clutch is # 038 141 031 h or 038 131 032 dx<br>
Model year 2000 cars may have either clutch but they probably have the sachs clutch.</p>
<p>
The Luk clutch/pressure plate is not the same clutch used in the VW 1.8T gas
engine but they look similar.&nbsp; The 1.8T engine 220mm PP is #06a 141 025 e, the 1.8T clutch is #06a 141 031
d.&nbsp; The 1.8T engine also used a 225mm clutch kit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/DSG_Flywheel_for_2006_Jetta_TDI_03G_105_266BE_p/dsg-flywheel.htm" target="_blank">Luk TDI clutch</a> can hold more torque
(about 250 ft-lbs) than the Sachs TDI clutch (about 190 ft lbs) before slipping.&nbsp;
These suggested torque limits are conservative and on the low end, some can go
higher without slipping.&nbsp; A power chip alone may be enough to cause the later clutches to slip, depending on the specific
driver, car mods, power curve, etc.&nbsp; Your car may be slightly different.</p>
<p>
Clutch fork is VW# 02j 131 719 c, clutch fork spring is #012 131 741, clutch

<p><u>Stronger clutch kits</u> The 228mm vr6 clutch is a good choice but will not bolt up to your existing
DMF.&nbsp; The 228mm 1990-1992 VW Corrado G60 solid flywheel will fit all model years
and will bolt up to the vr6 clutch and is the basic choice.&nbsp; Note: you can
use the vr6 clutch with a G60 flywheel but cannot use the vr6 flywheel because
6 cylinder engines use a different crankshaft bolt pattern.&nbsp; Also double
check the flywheel diameter.&nbsp; The clutch kit
can hold about 330 ft-lbs torque.&nbsp; Clutch pedal weight will be slightly
less than stock, read the full article for more details.&nbsp; There are also
clutch kits that use longer clutch hub springs that smooth NVH but it will
not be as great as a DMF.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also remember that you can't mix/match the
valeo and sachs clutch kit with a different brand PP.&nbsp; Most clutch kits
include both clutch and PP anyways.
</p>
<p><b>Mk5 VW TDI</b> 2005.5-2006 jetta
</p>
<p><u>Stock clutch</u><b> </b> The
car came from the factory with a DMF with solid hub clutch.&nbsp; Note: you can use the vr6 clutch kit
with the 4 cylinder flywheel but cannot use the vr6 flywheel because 6 cylinder
engines use a different bolt
pattern.&nbsp; The 1990-1992 VW Corrado G60 solid flywheel will fit all model years
and will bolt up to the vr6 clutch and is the basic choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are
also clutch kits that use longer clutch hub springs that help smooth NVH but it
will not be as great as a DMF.
</p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>: there is a TSB on the sachs clutch wearing out early.&nbsp; See
this <a href="../images/pdf/vw_tb_30-07-01.pdf">Sachs clutch TSB .pdf file</a>
on coverage of the sachs clutch until 4 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs
first.&nbsp; This does not apply to the Luk clutch.&nbsp; Cars made after
production date: CW 08/07 should use the Luk clutch.&nbsp; The best way to tell
what clutch you have is to look through the clutch inspection window.&nbsp;
Above the right axle flange on the transmission, there is an 8mm bolt holding
the inspection window.&nbsp; The sachs and luk clutch have different shaped
clutches, one is rounded and the other is more square.

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="wornclutch">Symptoms of a worn clutch</a></font></b>
</p>
<p>The TDI clutch is pretty sturdy.&nbsp; The most common reason for replacement is
because it slips or it's broken.&nbsp; Clutch slip is when you notice the rpm
move up without translating into forward motion (obviously not when the
transmission is in neutral or if you have an automatic transmission).&nbsp; If
you notice the rpm flutter and then go up with speed, you are slipping the
clutch before it catches.&nbsp; This is more likely when you suddenly mash the accelerator pedal down
because it's probably due to a torque spike.&nbsp; Once the torque spike
subsides, the clutch grips and the rpm stabilize.&nbsp; This is most likely to
occur in high gear.&nbsp; The best way to avoid large torque spikes is to
apply power smoothly instead of mashing the go-pedal down.&nbsp; Due to the torque
curve of a TDI, shifting at too low an RPM and giving too much load can aggravate
slipping.&nbsp; There could also be
glazing or oil leaking onto the clutch from the rear main seal which lowers the
coefficient of friction.&nbsp; Regardless of the reason, you have too much
torque for the clutch.&nbsp; If it's slipping occasionally, try to not apply accelerator
pedal too aggressively and some of the clutch glazing will wear off over time, restoring
some of the lost grip.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If the clutch is simply not working, it could be a few things.&nbsp; If the
clutch pedal goes to the floor or the shifter won't go into gear, it could be a
problem with the clutch hydraulic system or shifter and not the actual clutch.&nbsp; The
clutch springs (if using a solid flywheel) or spring holders can break off and
damage or jam the clutch system as well.&nbsp; The clutch fork/bearing can also
fail and cause poor clutch release/shifting.&nbsp; If quickly pumping the clutch
pedal or bleeding the hydraulic system makes a difference, the problem is most
likely with the master, slave cylinder, or hydraulic lines.&nbsp; The slave
normally goes first because water and contaminants settle at the low spot which
is the slave cylinder.&nbsp;
Noise could also be the motor mounts, flywheel, or a loose slave cylinder.&nbsp;
If the noise is &quot;growling&quot; only when the clutch pedal is pressed
enough to make the release bearing touch the pressure plate, the sound is
probably coming from the release bearing.&nbsp; The VW TDI clutch pedal does not
have any adjustment screws or levers.
</p>
<p>How long can a clutch last?&nbsp; In theory, the clutch disk could last
forever if you perfectly rev match every shift.&nbsp; However, the pressure
plate springs that clamp the clutch disk can get worn, oil can leak onto the
clutch, your &quot;friend&quot; goes drag racing when you ask
him to pick you up at the airport, etc...&nbsp; I wouldn't replace a clutch on the TDI
unless it's slipping.&nbsp; On some high performance cars, clutches might not
last past 150,000 miles, some exotics only get 15,000-30,000 miles out of a
clutch.&nbsp; The TDI has a pretty reliable clutch when power is left
at stock power levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;With mk4+ cars, the DMF sometimes breaks and
causes problems and the mk5 cars with a sachs clutch may be defective, see the
TSB mentioned above.&nbsp; When I removed my TDI clutch due to excess power
modifications at
160,000 miles, it was thick and was in excellent condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Most pressure plate springs actually increase the amount of holding force as
the clutch disk wears.&nbsp; However, if it passes the optimum point, holding
force decreases.&nbsp; Glazing or oil on the clutch surfaces can further reduce
holding force.
</p>
<p><b><font size="4"><a name="clutchpurpose">The purpose of a clutch</a></font></b></p>
<p>A clutch is a brake like disk sandwiched between the flywheel and pressure
plate.&nbsp; It couples power in a manual transmissions.&nbsp; The
flywheel is bolted to the crankshaft, and the pressure plate is bolted to the
flywheel.&nbsp; The clutch is the only part that is connected to the
transmission, through a splined hub at the center of the clutch.&nbsp; If you
separate the transaxle from the TDI engine, you'd see this: (flywheel-pressure plate on left)<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/transview.jpg" width="773" height="349">
</p>
<p> In a TDI,
when the clutch pedal is down, the pressure plate springs release the clutch and
the clutch spins independently of the flywheel and pressure plate.&nbsp;
When the clutch pedal is up, the pressure plate springs clamp the clutch, and the
clutch, flywheel, and pressure plate are spinning as one.&nbsp; All TDI and most
imports use a diaphragm type pressure plate.&nbsp; All TDI clutches
are dry clutches, this article does not discuss the wet clutches used in the DSG
&quot;manual - automatic&quot; transmission, please see <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
DSG FAQ</a> for more details on the DSG transmission.<br>

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="Resurfacing">Resurfacing the flywheel and new clutch break-in</a></font></b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/tdiclutch.jpg" align="right" width="363" height="342">If the flywheel is warped (extremely unlikely for a TDI), has excessive hot spots, or cracks, it must be replaced.&nbsp;
If it's in
very good condition you can use scotch brite to clean the surface and remove any
built up glazing.&nbsp; If you have a DMF (see below for more details), I
recommend replacement in most cases instead of reuse.&nbsp; When I removed my
non-DMF TDI clutch (shown right), it had a few
marks but no unusual damage or wear.&nbsp; After scrubbing it with medium
green scotch
brite and washing with brake cleaner, it was reusable as is.&nbsp; Wash until
the paper towel comes back clean to remove grease.</p>
<p>You can use 3M &quot;roloc&quot; pads
      or scotch brite to clean the surface.&nbsp; I would
recommended resurfacing the flywheel if you have any doubt if it's reusable
as-is.&nbsp;
If you have very high mileage, it's also a good time to replace the rear main oil seal.&nbsp; If
the seal leaks oil onto the clutch, it can cause your brand new clutch to slip.&nbsp;
      If you have lower mileage I would leave the oil seal alone unless it is
leaking.</p>
<p> A professional flywheel resurfacing involves removing the alignment pins and using a
blanchard grinder on the
friction surface that the clutch touches and the outer step/shelf that the pressure
plate bolts onto.&nbsp; Below right is a
picture of a resurfaced flywheel (non-TDI).&nbsp; You can see the pattern the
blanchard grinder left on the surface.&nbsp; A lathe is not a  good way to resurface a flywheel
because the cutting tool can skip over hardened spots and leave an uneven
surface.</p>
<p>Below left is a picture of an unusable flywheel with hot spots and
  cracks.&nbsp; A TDI doesn't rev that high and you should get wheelspin in drag
  style launches instead of excessive clutch slip, so most TDI flywheels can be
  reused.&nbsp; Note: wheel hop quickly kills differentials and shocks the
  driveline in a really bad way so if you feel the wheels quickly catching and bouncing
  while doing drag style acceleration, immediately let off the accelerator pedal.&nbsp;
  Never use the clutch to hold the car on a hill! It won't burn up the clutch to the degree shown below but it causes totally uncessary heat and wear.<br>
  <img border="0" src="../images/crackfly.jpg" width="500" height="339">&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../images/resurface.JPG" width="414" height="358"></p>
<p>
  When resurfacing a stepped flywheel, they must remove equal amounts of material from both
  the friction surface and the outer step/shelf that the pressure plate bolts to.&nbsp;
  This keeps the lever arm relationship between the pressure plate and friction
  surface equal.&nbsp; Failure to keep this relationship equal changes the force
  that the lever arm of the pressure plate springs.&nbsp; If you go to a
  machine shop, tell them that you want to measure the step and runout after they're done.&nbsp;
  Double check their work by measuring it yourself before and after.&nbsp; If the step or
  runout is off, you'll have a poorly operating clutch or you'll have to pull the clutch again
to have them fix the step height. This can be prevented by quickly verifying the step height before and after.</p>
<p>
If the flywheel step is too shallow or lower than the correct measurement, the
pressure plate diaphragm compresses more and the springs are going to be more
flat.&nbsp; This may lead to release problems if the travel of the clutch
release fork and throw out bearing is maxed out when the clutch pedal is fully
depressed.&nbsp; The clutch might also slip since the diaphragm is compressed
beyond the point of its maximum torque capacity.<br>
<br>
If the flywheel step is too deep or high, the pressure plate diaphragm
compresses less and its fingers are going to be less flat. The clutch will
disengage better (since the clutch fork will have enough travel left), but the
pedal will be heavier as the maximum torque capacity point has to be passed when
disengaging the clutch.&nbsp; The installed height of the pressure plate will
decrease with the clutch disc wear and the maximum torque capacity will
consequently decrease.</p>
<p>
Shimming the pivot bolt of the clutch fork or excess wear on the clutch fork or
pivot due to a heavy clutch pedal can also change the distance that the throw
out bearing moves when you press on the clutch pedal.</p>
<p>Some general tips: when putting on the clutch kit, wipe down the
flywheel and pressure plate with rubbing alcohol or brake cleaner to remove any
grease or oil from machining or your hands.&nbsp; Use a clutch alignment
tool when centering the clutch.&nbsp; Use a THIN layer of high temp grease on
the input spline.&nbsp; When tightening the pressure plate bolts,
tighten in a diagonal pattern and in stages.&nbsp; If you have an even number of
bolts you can do 2 turns on each opposite bolt, moving around the plate, until almost
at final torque stage.&nbsp; Once they're all loosely tight, tighten them to the
final torque.&nbsp; &quot;Skip 1
bolt, skip 1, skip
2&quot; also works depending on how many bolts there are and in what pattern.&nbsp;
This ensures that the pressure plate stays flat while you tighten it to the
flywheel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Clutch break in</b></p>
<p>To break in the new clutch, use lower load/rpm operation with smooth
engagements and avoid excess slipping.  300 miles of city driving should be enough.&nbsp;
Harsher materials such as feramic or puck clutches will wear into the flywheel
and pressure plate more than softer materials such as organic disks, so plan for
longer break in before full clutch clamping force is available.&nbsp; Harsher clutches need to wear into flywheel and pressure plate
before they will hold their full rated force.&nbsp; Some minor chatter upon clutch
engagement is normal, especially for harder clutches, it should go away as the
clutch breaks in.<br>

<br>
<b>Solid flywheel</b><br>
<br>
This is the type of flywheel used on most older cars.&nbsp; It is the factory
flywheel on the mk3 TDI.&nbsp; It is a solid piece of cast iron with a starter ring
gear that is heat shrunk onto the outer diameter.&nbsp; When you turn the ignition key to start, the
starter engages the ring gear which turns the flywheel.&nbsp; It rarely fails
but does not dampen any engine vibrations.&nbsp; Because of this, street clutches
used with a solid flywheel have damping springs on the hub.&nbsp; The flywheel is typically
lighter than a DMF but because the clutch has springs, the clutch is
heavier.&nbsp; Even though it's very rare for the flywheel to break, the clutch
used with a solid flywheel has springs that can break out of their spring
windows and cause problems.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/segment.jpg" width="500" height="425"><br>
Here is a picture of a lightened racing aluminum flywheel.&nbsp; The starter ring
gear is on the outermost diameter.&nbsp; This specific flywheel is made of
aluminum with steel inserts for the friction surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since it's
aluminum, the pressure plate holes use helicoils.&nbsp; The reason it has
segmented plates instead of a solid ring is so the segments can withstand abuse
and expand independently
without warping.&nbsp; Lightened aluminum flywheels can warp the friction
surface when overheated due to the differences between the inner and outer
diameter.&nbsp; Since the outer diameter travels a greater distance in one
rotation than the inner diameter, a slipping clutch will heat and warp the outer
diameter more and decrease the amount of surface area that is gripping, leading
to more slipping.&nbsp; This is not a factor for a daily driver, but if you plan
on drag racing the car, a non lightened solid
flywheel will act as a better heat sink and hold more kinetic energy, giving
better 60' times in drag racing.&nbsp; A lightened flywheel is more suited for road
racing or autocross.&nbsp; For daily driving, I recommend a stock weight flywheel
since most will find it gives better drivability, comfort, less noise/vibration,
and because it's more economical to
reuse the stock flywheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;A diesel relies on compression to ignite
the fuel and a stock weight flywheel will also prevent loss of rotational
inertia.</p>
<p>If your car already uses a solid flywheel, my suggestion is to reuse
it.&nbsp; Stock TDI flywheels weigh about 20 lbs and help act as a damper to the
jerky power delivery of a diesel.&nbsp; This is also why you
should avoid lightening the injection pump sprocket or other TDI
sprockets.&nbsp; Heavier sprockets act like flywheels and help dampen the
jerky vibration of the injection pump and crankshaft on the timing belt and
other components.</p>
<p><b>Don't forget the pressure plate</b></p>
<p>Your clutch kit normally includes a pressure plate.&nbsp; The pressure plate
clamps the clutch on the opposite side of the flywheel.&nbsp; The pressure ring,
the contact surface of the pressure plate, is normally made of a single piece of
cast iron (pictured below).<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/pplate.jpg" width="640" height="311"></p>
<p><b>The dual mass flywheel (DMF)</b><br>
<br>
A dual mass flywheel (DMF) is a flywheel which is 2 pieces connected with a damping system.&nbsp;
Because the flywheel handles damping, the clutch can be made without a
spring hub which makes the clutch lighter.&nbsp; A lighter clutch reduces synchronizer wear.&nbsp;
The tradeoff is increased complexity and a heavier flywheel because of the addition of internal dampers.&nbsp; If you
replace the DMF with a solid flywheel, it is suggested to use a clutch with a
spring hub. A solid replacement will chatter more than your old
flywheel because even though the spring hub is helping absorb energy, the
overall effect is not as great compared to a DMF.&nbsp; These low RPM vibrations
are best dampened by a DMF.&nbsp; There is a harmonic balancer pulley on the
other side of the crankshaft but these are most needed at higher RPM and won't
dampen idle chatter.</p>
<p>Almost all new German cars (manual transmission) come with a DMF.&nbsp; Because they're 2 big pieces and many small pieces instead of 1 solid piece, it's possible for
the dampers to fail.&nbsp; Typical failure modes in the TDI DMF are a separation of the DMF causing failure of the damping system and sometimes even &quot;liberation&quot; of fragments, flying pieces of the
flywheel which can damage the transmission.&nbsp; Black leaking oil (actually DMF grease) could from a
leaking flywheel instead of a oil leaking out of the rear main crankshaft seal.&nbsp; The real problem with the DMF is that they are tuned to a diesel's specific resonant characteristics, power levels, and can overpower the springs inside the
flywheel if you raise the energy absorbed by the flywheel too much.&nbsp; A heavily modified car
might exceed the original design limits so it's suggested to use a solid
flywheel on a heavily modified car.&nbsp; If the flywheel is damaged and the
layers slip too much, it can even break and cover the flywheel bolt holes, making removal
a real problem.&nbsp; If this happens, you can sometimes use a prybar to move
the bolt holes into the correct position.&nbsp; Other times it's completely jammed and
you have to cut holes to access the bolt heads.&nbsp; An example of this from
twotone is
pictured below. If it's really jammed like this you have to  cut away some metal to  access  the bolt heads.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/faildmf.jpg" width="414" height="295"></p>
<p>If your car uses a DMF, my suggestion is to
      replace it as necessary with a direct replacement or a regular flywheel.&nbsp;
      Select a solid regular flywheel or DMF depending on your
      power modification level, personal tolerance for increased NVH, and car
      history/mileage and driving style.&nbsp; I do not suggest buying a used DMF with
      an unknown history because the internals are considered a wear part.&nbsp;
      Some DMF are rebuildable and DMF can be resurfaced, but the TDI
      DMF cannot be rebuilt with new internals.&nbsp; Most people report that
      the VW TDI DMF has very hard surface and successfully reused it after a
      good cleaning and scrubbing with scotch brite.&nbsp; Unless you are using
      the car for drag racing, it's likely that the flywheel surface is
      reusable.&nbsp; Almost all people who switch to
      a solid flywheel are happy with it but notice slightly more NVH in idle
and a clutch pedal engagement slightly closer to the floor. </p>

<p><b>
      Other dampening factors</b></p>
<p>Something else to consider is the front crankshaft damper, the harmonic
balancer pulley.&nbsp; This also has a small effect on reducing NVH, especially
on the serpentine belt, alternator, AC, power steering, etc.&nbsp; Some engines
can safely use a lightened pulley or underdrive (smaller diameter) pulley to
reduce parasitic power losses on the engine.&nbsp; I do not recommend using a
lightened or underdrive pulley on the TDI engine.&nbsp; The power pulses in the
4 cylinder TDI engine are abrupt and it's partly why a TDI engine has
more vibration than a comparable 4 cylinder gas VW engine.&nbsp; I believe that the
stock weight pulley is needed to dampen the greater stresses that a diesel engine
sees.&nbsp; In addition, the moment of inertia is close to the pulley axis, so
there is probably only a very small power increase by using a lighter pulley.</p>
<p>The mk3 pulley will slip over time and will make a chirping noise, especially
on cold starts. If your mk3 TDI makes a chirping noise that increases with lower
temperatures and cold starts and higher electrical load, the pulley and
tensioner should be replaced with the revised pulley.&nbsp; See <a href="a3b4/tdi-cold-chirp-noise.htm">1000q:
mk3 cold chirping noise fix</a> for the detailed procedure.&nbsp; The mk4 pulley used
2 different harmonic balancers, 1998-2002 pulleys are slightly heavier than the
2003-2005 pulleys and are interchangeable as long as you use the correct length
allen bolts for the pulley.&nbsp; Early mk4 harmonic pulley allen bolts are
slightly longer than the later mk4 allen bolts.</p>

<b><font size="4"><a name="clutch">Clutch types and materials</a></font></b></p>
<p>
There are a few types of clutch designs.&nbsp; <u>Keep in mind that clutch feel,
chatter, drivability, and smoothness is very subjective</u>.&nbsp; Don't buy
more clutch than you realistically need since it's normally at the loss of
drivability.&nbsp; If you are using a solid flywheel I suggest
using a full face sprung hub clutch.&nbsp; If you are using a dual mass flywheel you
should use a full face solid hub clutch.&nbsp; Most TDI are not being used for
racing, so a full faced clutch is a better choice than a puck clutch for street
use.&nbsp; A full face means that the clutch is shaped like a ring with the
splined hub in the middle.&nbsp;&nbsp;All TDI clutches are dry clutches, this
article does not discuss the wet clutches used in the DSG &quot;manual -
automatic&quot; transmission, see <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm"> 1000q: DSG FAQ</a> for details on the DSG
transmission.</p>
<p>A full face sprung hub clutch uses springs in the center splined hub and a
marcel spring (looks like a thin wavy ring) between the plates to help absorb energy transmitted from
the engine and make clutch engagement smoother.&nbsp; It is held together with
rivets that go though one face, through the marcel springs sandwiched between
the faces, and to the other
face.&nbsp; With a solid flywheel, a sprung
hub with full face will give the smoothest clutch engagement.&nbsp; Pictured
below left is a full faced sprung hub.&nbsp; The springs soften driveline
shock.&nbsp; The only disadvantage is that
the springs could break out of the spring window, pictured below right.&nbsp; A clutch like this one
was used on all mk3 TDI.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/springhub.jpg" width="400" height="382">&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../images/brokenspring.jpg" width="515" height="317"><br>
  Clutches used with DMF normally use a solid hub because the DMF does
an even better job of absorbing energy than a sprung hub clutch.&nbsp; Because a
solid hub clutch has less mass, it puts less wear on the transmission
synchronizers.&nbsp; Since there are no hub springs, it's also less likely to break
and damage the clutch system.&nbsp; All mk4+ TDI used a solid hub full faced
disk.&nbsp; In theory, switching to a solid flywheel and using a sprung hub
clutch increases transmission synchro wear due to heavier clutch disk weight,
but the difference is minimal.&nbsp; The same basic transmission is used in the
mk3 cars, and they all came with sprung hub clutches, so in reality, driving/shifting style
is a far greater factor in synchro and transmission wear.&nbsp; A solid hub looks like the hub in the puck clutch pictured below.</p>
<p>A puck clutch (pictured below) is a clutch that has a star shaped friction surface instead of
a disk.&nbsp; Some are solid hubs, others are sprung.&nbsp; It's better than a full face disk for racing use because it clamps faster and
harder due to the materials used and the design.&nbsp; They could be used for street use but have
lower
lifespan and an on-off engagement because the design and materials used make it
hard to slip.&nbsp; People watching you parallel park with a puck clutch may think you don't know how to drive stick
because trying to slip one will cause the car to buck.&nbsp; I
don't think many TDI drivers are drag racing enough to warrant a puck clutch so
I do not suggest a puck clutch.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/puckc.jpg" width="432" height="289"><br>
A twin disk system is a clutch kit that uses two clutch disks, more on this
below.&nbsp; In my opinion, this is overkill for any 4 cylinder TDI.&nbsp; If
you had a 6 cylinder AWD drag racing TDI, a twin disk would be a great choice to
avoid constantly frying clutches.</p>
<p><b>Clutch disk materials</b></p>
<p>Keep in mind that some disks have one side made of one material and the other
side made of another.&nbsp; <u>Keep in mind that clutch feel, chatter,
drivability and smoothness is very subjective</u>.&nbsp; Old cars used clutches that contained asbestos,
I don't think anyone sells these in the US anymore but the general precaution when working on an old car, especially pre-1990,
is to treat it as if dust
inside the transmission bellhousing could contain asbestos.&nbsp; I
don't use air tools on the flywheel to keep dust down.</p>
<table border="0" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="100%" valign="top">Pictured on the right is a kevlar disk in
      yellow, copper disk at bottom left, and black organic face disk at bottom
      right.&nbsp; All use
      sprung hubs.&nbsp; Some clutch material terms are misnamed because of
      marketing.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Most street disks are made with organic faced material.&nbsp; This is
      similar to brake pad material.&nbsp; It has
      the smoothest engagement but can slip if it overheats.&nbsp; If you are
      shifting under high rpm and heavy load, this can overheat an organic disk,
      resulting in a burning smell and a lower coefficient of friction.&nbsp;
      Typical stop-go driving is not enough to overheat this disk but excessive
      slipping can.&nbsp; Full throttle drag races with heavy clutch
      slipping can glaze this type of disk.&nbsp; The nice thing about organic
      disks is that if it starts to smoke, let it cool and drive normally.&nbsp;
      It may regain most of it's clamping force.&nbsp; It is probably the best choice for a
      smooth, long life, lightweight
      clutch on a daily driver.</td>

</table>
<p>Feramic is a good choice for mild drag racing and street use.&nbsp; It is a
mix of ceramic and sintered iron.&nbsp; It's normally found in a full faced disk
and can become hotter than an organic disk without weakening, about 900<sup>o</sup>.&nbsp;
Because of this, it's a good choice if you want a smooth street disk and plan on
doing an occasional drag race.&nbsp; However, since it is also heavier than
organic disks, it will wear out the transmission synchros faster than a lighter
disk.&nbsp; It will also not rev as fast but the effect will not be very noticeable
on a TDI.&nbsp; Some clutches also use feramic on the flywheel side
to withstand slipping and organic on the pressure plate side for smoother
engagement and weight loss. It is also a good choice for AWD vehicles used in
drag racing because an AWD launch involves more slipping than a 2WD
vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sintered iron is harder than feramic.&nbsp; An iron clutch will have more grip than a feramic clutch but
will wear out the flywheel and pressure plate faster and are heavier.&nbsp; An
iron clutch will be slightly softer than a ceramic clutch but both are
considered aggressive clutches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Expect a short clutch/flywheel life,
I do not recommend for the TDI.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kevlar clutches can be more expensive than an organic clutch.&nbsp; Engagement
depends on temperature and like feramic, it can withstand a lot more slipping
and higher temps than an
organic clutch.&nbsp; This clutch is resistant to glazing but once it does, will
have a hard time recovering.&nbsp; For a more modified car, this may be a good choice and it
should have a longer clutch life compare to other aggressive clutches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ceramic clutches are harder than sintered iron and is part of what feramic
clutches are a blend of.&nbsp; A ceramic clutch is considered a hard clutch and
is very grabby.&nbsp; It is more of a race clutch than for street due to it's hard
engagement.</p>
<p>Bronze alloy is often used for puck clutches.&nbsp; Because you normally find this on a puck clutch, it will
have harsh engagement.&nbsp; It will also wear into the flywheel more and have a
shorter lifespan.&nbsp; It will also have a shorter lifespan, not recommended
for a TDI.&nbsp; This is more
of a race clutch than a street clutch material.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carbon clutches are normally used for racing applications where it is
expected to slip a lot.&nbsp; They can withstand up to 2000<sup>o</sup> temps
without destruction.&nbsp; Engagement changes a lot depending on
temperature and they normally slip a bit under normal street use.&nbsp; This is a clutch that needs to slip and
heat up before reaching maximum holding force.&nbsp; It's actually a clutch
which you can slip without damaging the clutch material.&nbsp; Again, since &quot;drivability&quot;
is a very subjective term, these suggestions are conservative.&nbsp; I would not
use this on a street car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<b><font size="4"><a name="force">Bearing wear vs increased pressure plate clamping
force</a>&nbsp;</font></b>
</p>
<p>You may be asking yourself, to keep smooth engagement and increase clamping
force, why not just use less aggressive clutch disks with a stronger pressure plate?&nbsp; There is room
for the designers to adjust clutch material and pressure plate strength, but in general, you don't want to
increase pressure plate clamping force too much for a number of reasons.&nbsp;
The VW TDI engine is only 4 cylinders and doesn't make a huge amount of torque
compared to much larger performance engines, but it's part of why you don't want
a clutch kit that is overkill.&nbsp; Again, modify your car with a goal.
</p>
<p>
First is increased clutch pedal effort.&nbsp; Everything
else being equal, your clutch pedal will be harder to actuate with a stronger
pressure plate.&nbsp; However, all clutches and pressure plates are not equal.&nbsp; When moving
from a stock TDI clutch kit to a stock vr6 clutch kit, you use the vr6 pressure plate.&nbsp; The
diaphragm spring lever arms are not at the same
fulcrum as the TDI spring arms, so it actually reduces pedal effort.&nbsp;
Below is a cutaway picture from luk.com of a pressure plate.&nbsp; The side view shows
the diaphragm spring pivoting on a fulcrum.&nbsp; By changing the fulcrum, you
change pedal effort and clamping force.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/luk.jpg" width="450" height="388">
</p>
<p>A very heavy pedal also takes a toll&nbsp; on other clutch system
components.&nbsp; If you are building a setup with a very heavy pedal, depending on
mileage, you should rebuild the clutch/slave cylinders as preventative
maintenance and replace the fork pivot ball with a hardened piece with the same
dimensions.&nbsp; I've broken clutch forks and
noticed wear on non TDI fork pivot balls/pins as well.&nbsp; Due to the relatively low power levels of the 4 cylinder
TDI, there are not a large number of broken forks but it's a good idea to
replace it at the same time as clutch replacement if you have high mileage.&nbsp;
Clutch pedal bushing wear and flexing of the firewall where the clutch pedal is
mounted can also be a big problem with heavy clutch pedals by affecting clutch
pedal action.&nbsp; This is not a significant factor with the 4 cylinder TDI due to the relatively
light clutches used.
</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the front and back of a pressure plate.&nbsp; The
release bearing was placed on top of the PP springs.&nbsp; Your TDI clutch may
look different.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/pplate.jpg" width="640" height="311">
</p>
<p>Another big reason why it's better to use a more aggressive clutch material
and a lighter spring is because it reduces axial loading on the crankshaft bearings.&nbsp; The
disadvantage is that a more aggressive material tends to have a hard
engagement and/or shorter life.&nbsp; A heavier pedal, especially on cold
starts where the crankshaft thrust bearing is not getting lubrication, does wear
parts more than they were designed for.&nbsp; The increased load on the crankshaft bearings and
hydraulic system is only when the clutch pedal is down.&nbsp; This is because
when the clutch pedal is up and the clutch is engaged, the force of the pressure
plate is working against the pressure plate bolts which are attached to the
flywheel.&nbsp; When you press the pedal down, the release bearing is pushing
the pressure plate which is pushing the crankshaft.&nbsp; This is another reason why it's better
for engine wear to leave the shifter in neutral and
clutch pedal up when you are sitting at a stoplight.&nbsp; This also prevents
the car from suddenly moving forward if the clutch pedal suddenly fails but it
slows your reaction if you need to quickly move forward, like if you are about
to get rear ended.&nbsp; If your car has a low
oil pressure problem, this makes the problem even worse.&nbsp; Again, the VW TDI
uses a pretty light clutch with a pretty stout engine, so this issue does not
appear to be a major factor for the TDI.
</p>
<p>To reduce pressure plate load and increase clutch strength, a twin disk is a
good option.&nbsp; This doubles the friction surface area which doubles the
torque rating with the same clamp load.&nbsp; It lets you use a less
aggressive friction material which also increases drivability.&nbsp; In my
opinion, this is way overkill for a 4 cylinder TDI.&nbsp; Here are two
examples of twin disk clutch kits, from<font size="1">
