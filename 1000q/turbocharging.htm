<h3><a name="basics">Turbocharger basics</a>
</h3>
<p>Let's start with the basics:&nbsp;a turbocharger is an engine exhaust gas
driven
turbine that compresses the engine intake air. This increases the amount of air the
engine can consume and increases volumetric efficiency. By compressing the air and increasing the density, you use a given volume of
engine displacement more efficiently (volumetric efficiency).&nbsp; Denser air means more air atoms and
more fuel atoms can be burned in the engine.&nbsp; This lets the engine make more power.</p>
<p>As a side note, you may have heard of nitrous or the brand name &quot;NOS&quot;.&nbsp;
Using nitrous oxide as a fuel for gasoline engines dramatically increases the amount of
oxygen in the engine's combustion cylinders, cools the air charge, and allows more fuel to be
burned.&nbsp; More fuel + more air =&nbsp; more power.&nbsp; Top fuel dragsters use a fuel of
about 85% nitromethane and 15%
methane in engines with a relatively small displacement but with power
measured in the thousands of horsepower (hp).&nbsp; Since the fuel is over
50% oxygen, its concentration of energy possible from a given space, its
volumetric efficiency, is much greater than an engine burning regular air
which is only about 21% oxygen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most modern turbocharged engines
seem to be 4 cylinders and often have as much or more power than a 6 cylinder non turbo engine.&nbsp; You may be
asking yourself why  car manufacturers just don't turbocharge all cars?&nbsp; Because
it costs more money to design and build, larger engines usually have better low end power, and they
can charge a premium for larger engines and that V8 sticker.&nbsp;&nbsp;And in
many cases (like the Corvette) a big engine just works!&nbsp; Although
you can add turbocharging to a non turbo car, it's difficult to do properly,
read more details in <a href="turbochargingpage2.htm#diyt">1000
answered questions: turbocharging your own car</a>.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of turbocharging is to increase air density to make more oxygen
available to burn.&nbsp; The energy from combustion, the burning of air and
fuel, is what pushes the engine pistons down, creating
energy.&nbsp; This increase in air density, or boost, is expressed in
pressure.&nbsp; In the US, the most
commonly used unit of pressure is pounds/sq. in, or psi.&nbsp; Other common
units of pressure are bar or kPa.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambient air pressure at sea level
is about 14.7 (about 1 bar) under standard conditions but boost in North America
is expressed as the difference from ambient.&nbsp; In other words, at 10 psi of
boost, the car's air intake is seeing 24.7 psi total pressure but you just say
10 psi.</p>
<p>Diesel engines are normally under boost or ambient
atmospheric air pressure because they do not use throttles for controlling
engine rpm.&nbsp; The newer TDI do use an air throttle for EGR gas metering but
it has nothing to do with directly controlling engine rpm.&nbsp; See <a href="egr-system-clogging-TDI.htm">1000q:
EGR FAQ</a> and <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: DPF and Adblue fluid
FAQ</a> for more details on the newer systems.&nbsp; Non turbo gasoline engines
have a vacuum when running because they suck air in while they run.&nbsp; Turbo
gasoline
engines can be under either boost or vacuum depending on how much the turbo is
boosting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> Here are some examples of boost vs. vacuum vs. ambient.&nbsp; If the engine is
off, a vacuum/boost gauge would read 0.&nbsp; This means that the gauge is measuring a
difference of 0 psi between the intake and ambient pressure.&nbsp; If a gas engine
is running at idle, the gauge will normally show a negative reading, for example -7.&nbsp;
This means that the intake is under 7 psi vacuum and has a lower pressure than ambient
air.&nbsp; If you press on the throttle pedal 100% while the engine is under
load, the gauge will indicate a change from vacuum to boost, or positive
pressure.&nbsp; This means that the turbo has pressurized the intake air more
than ambient by whatever amount the gauge shows.&nbsp; The boost gauge sensor is
always downstream of the turbo and in the intake path.</p>
<h3><a name="directinjection">Turbocharging in diesel engines
and direct injection</a></h3>
<p>Modern passenger car diesels are all turbocharged for a few reasons.&nbsp; Diesel
engines are naturally very robust because of the characteristics of the diesel
cycle and high compression ratio, so they naturally have a stronger design to withstand
the additional pressures of turbocharging.&nbsp; They also use a smaller rpm
range vs. a gasoline engine so the turbo doesn't have to perform over the wider rpm range of a gasoline engine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turbos also maximize the benefit from direct fuel injection.&nbsp; There are many variations on how high the pressure is,
how long the injection is, what the brand name of injection type is called, and how many injections there are.&nbsp;
For the TDI diesel, please see <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">1000q: direct injection,
pumpe duse, and common rail</a> for more details.&nbsp; Older diesels and most
modern gasoline cars use port injection where the fuel is injected in the intake
manifold before the combustion chamber.&nbsp; Direct injection means the fuel is
injected directly into the engine cylinder at the moment of ignition.&nbsp; The
higher pressure also helps: which burns faster: finely shredded paper or paper tightly wadded into a ball?&nbsp; The higher pressure
produces finer fuel atomization and also allows higher engine compression and higher boost in turbo
engines.&nbsp; When gasoline is injected under very high pressure into the combustion cylinders,
it immediately vaporizes and is ignited by the spark plug so fast that it helps
prevent uncontrolled detonation of the fuel.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater control over the
moment of injection also results in cleaner emissions because of a more thorough
fuel burn, which increases fuel economy.</p>
<p> The
ratio of air to fuel (AF ratio) in a diesel engine is variable since diesel
engines can run well within a large range.&nbsp; As a very rough estimate, your
TDI (including chipped and modified cars) runs between 15:1-50:1 AF, being very smoky
at the rich end.&nbsp; This is because a diesel is throttled by fuel, not air.&nbsp;
Diesels normally run ultra lean which is one of the reasons why they have great
fuel economy.&nbsp; A turbo gasoline engine's
AF is about 13:1 to 11:1 under heavy boost,
whereas a nonturbo engine should be at roughly 14:1.&nbsp; A turbo car's computer
will change fuel delivery under boost by increasing fueling and making the AF richer.&nbsp;
Note that this is
adjusted to the amount of air it <i>thinks</i> the engine is getting, not the
amount of air the engine is <i>actually</i> getting.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference
could be from faulty sensors or an air leak that lets out air that has already been
measured by the sensors&nbsp; See <a href="multi/boost-leak-tester-DIY-check.htm">1000q:
boost and vacuum leak</a> checking for a simple procedure to test for boost
leaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the sensors see something wrong or detonation is detected (gas cars),
gasoline turbo cars' computer switch to a safety map that retards ignition
timing and reduces boost.&nbsp; This prevents any further damage or keeps the
condition from getting worse.&nbsp; In a TDI, the car goes into limp mode if it sees something
wrong.&nbsp; Two signs that you are in limp mode are: the car feels like it
suddenly hit a strong headwind and power is restored by turning off the car and
restarting the engine.&nbsp; See <a href="multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">1000q:
limp mode troubleshooting</a> for solutions.</p>

<h3><a name="basicparts">Basic parts of a turbocharger</a></h3>
<p>The turbocharger's basic parts are the compressor side, turbine side, and the
center housing which connects the two sides.&nbsp; The turbine, or exhaust side,
has a small pinwheel-like turbine that is spun by exhaust gasses.&nbsp; Built
into the housing is an internal wastegate that lets excess exhaust gas and
pressure out.&nbsp; If the turbo is an external wastegate, the wastegate is not
built into the turbine housing and is somewhere else.&nbsp; Modern TDI turbos
even have a one piece exhaust manifold and turbine housing.&nbsp; Earlier and
many aftermarket TDI turbos use a separate exhaust manifold and turbo turbine
housing.</p>
<p>The exhaust housing is normally cast iron and the intake hosing is normally
aluminum.&nbsp; Some exciting developments in turbo technology include stainless steel
investment cast (like lost wax casting) exhaust housings which give smoother
internal flow, reduce thermal inertia, and reduce the amount of weight hanging
off the exhaust manifolds.&nbsp; The exhaust side also holds the internal
wastegate, if equipped.</p>
<p> The other side, the compressor or intake side, also has a pinwheel-like impeller, powered by a straight shaft
from the turbine wheel.&nbsp; Its job is to compress the intake air.&nbsp; The
center housing, or center hub rotating assembly (CHRA), is the part that houses
the shaft and bearings that the two wheels spin on, and normally contains oil
and coolant to lubricate it all.&nbsp; The turbo used in the VW TDI is
oil cooled only.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/turbo.gif" width="700" height="287">
</p>
<p> <img border="0" src="../images/disasmall.jpg" align="right" width="640" height="393">The wheels and shaft can often reach
speeds of 50,000 to 200,000 rpm which is why they require proper cooling and
lubrication. Warning:&nbsp; do not reroute the CHRA oil or coolant lines without
first considering any possible complications.&nbsp; A bent line could cause the CHRA
to be starved of oil or coolant, damaging the turbo.&nbsp;
After engine shutdown, there is natural convection circulation in the turbo's oil and coolant
lines from the turbo cooling off.&nbsp; Rerouting these lines incorrectly can
reduce this natural circulation,
possibly causing long term damage.&nbsp; It's also important not to exceed tilt
specs because it will cause drain back issues and bearing wear.</p>
 In most cases, the CHRA is fed from the
same oil supply as the engine.&nbsp; Some turbos, like the VW TDI turbos, are
      cooled by engine oil only.&nbsp; Most gasoline turbos are cooled by
      separate engine oil and water coolant lines.
      <p> The turbo pictured at right is a ball bearing
turbo and had some damage to the wheels.</p>
      <p> On a side note, don't use silicone hoses for turbo oil drain/return or
      power steering lines because they can sweat and leak.&nbsp; Some may have
      a Fluro lining to prevent this but any problems and it will sweat, making
      a mess and requiring replacement.&nbsp; Silicone is acceptable for air and
      most coolant hoses.</p>
<h3><a name="Componentselection">Component selection and turbo
      design</a></h3>
<p>The turbo output and performance is chosen carefully by engineers for a
certain range of performance.&nbsp; I'll describe
sizing and characteristics of these components in detail in this
section.&nbsp;&nbsp;Choosing a smaller turbo and turbo
components will give better low end power but cannot move air efficiently at the
top end.&nbsp; A larger turbo and turbo components has better top end but less low end power
potential than a smaller turbo.</p>
<p>The first issue is fitment.&nbsp; If a larger turbo will not fit into the old
turbo's space or has a different style housing, you have to change
other components such as the exhaust manifold, downpipe, and motor mounts to get
it to fit and bolt on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some VW turbos have the exhaust manifold and
turbo exhaust housing as one piece so they must be changed out as a single unit
or replaced as a separate manifold and turbo.&nbsp; If the turbo inlet or outlet
is facing the wrong direction, you may have to clock the turbo by loosening the
housings and rotating them to orient the turbo in the correct direction.</p>
<p>Another issue is housing size - this has a big effect on turbo efficiency.&nbsp; If a compressor's housing is too big, the
exhaust gasses will not be efficiently directed onto the wheel.&nbsp; If the housing
is too small, exhaust gasses will back up and create a bottleneck in the
airflow.&nbsp; Modern diesel cars use a variable vane geometry turbo to change the
way exhaust gasses are directed in the housing to maximize efficiency.&nbsp; No
modern gasoline car uses this type of turbo except the Porsche 911 turbo.&nbsp; The most dangerous condition is when a housing
and/or impeller is sized improperly and creates a large area of performance in
which the impeller compresses the air so much that becomes too hot and unable
to be efficiently cooled.&nbsp; This can cause uncontrolled detonation in a
gasoline engine, probably causing severe damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next thing to examine is the size of the pinwheel like exhaust
compressor wheel and intake turbine wheel.&nbsp; Like a larger or smaller pinwheel, the larger a
turbo wheel is, the more air it can move.&nbsp; For Garrett turbos, the wheel size is called
trim size.&nbsp; Trim size is a ratio of the
inducer/exducer sizes squared times 100.&nbsp; Basically, a larger trim means a larger wheel which can move more air.
</p>
<h3><a name="Turbosystem">Turbo selection as part
of a whole system and volumetric efficiency</a></h3>
<p>The most important characteristic of each turbo component is that they have
to work well as part of a whole system.&nbsp; If the exhaust housing is small but its
turbine is large, the airflow will get choked.&nbsp; If the exhaust housing is
large but the turbine is small, the airflow will not be efficiently directed at
the turbine.&nbsp; The exhaust and intake side also should be in harmony. The
intake side compresses a certain amount
  of air into the motor and should expect an appropriately sized exhaust side to flow the
  exhaust gas back out.&nbsp; The whole system has to work in harmony to achieve
efficient operation.&nbsp; Like a water funnel, no matter how much water you put
into the top, there is a range of how much water can come out the bottom.&nbsp; An inappropriately sized and/or
matched component will prevent the components from working in the area of good
efficiency, performance, and value.&nbsp; Each mod should have a set of
supporting mods working towards an overall goal.&nbsp; Before choosing
components and modifying your car, have an estimate of about how much power you want,
then design the modifications around making that overall goal.&nbsp; Meeting that
power goal using a combination of the smallest turbo, the least turbo boost, and the most efficient
intercooler, will all reduce engine stresses and maximize engine response.</p>
<p>For a chart of stock and upgraded turbos for the TDI, see <a href="tditurbo.htm">1000q:
turbo upgrade chart</a>.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that changing turbo components are only a part of
increasing volumetric efficiency (VE).&nbsp; Adding camshafts, porting or tuning
the intake manifold and cylinder heads, all change the volumetric efficiency and
will further contribute to the efficiency of the engine.&nbsp; Modified camshafts
are more applicable to gasoline engines.</p>
<h3><a name="A/R ratio">A/R ratio</a></h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/arratio.jpg" align="left" width="170" height="136">An important term to know when
talking about turbo housings is it's aspect
ratio (AR).&nbsp; It's not important to know for a non modified car but it's
still useful to know what an AR is.&nbsp; AR is the ratio of the area of the cone to radius
from the center hub.&nbsp; If you were to measure the cross section on
any point on the turbo and divide by the distance from the center of that cross
section to the center of the turbine wheel, you would get the AR ratio.&nbsp;
Ideally, this ratio should remain the same as you move in and out of the turbo
housing because the housing gets smaller as you get closer to the center.&nbsp;
This spiral shaped cone is called a volute.&nbsp; It begins where the flange opening
changes to the shape of the volute.&nbsp; Basically, it
concentrates airflow at a point on the turbo wheels through the spiral shape.&nbsp;
Comparing only AR mean much because engine displacement, tune, supporting mods, and rpm,
etc.,&nbsp; also effect turbo spool up.&nbsp; But everything else being equal, increasing the AR will reduce spool up but increase
top end performance by allowing more air to flow.&nbsp; Decreasing the AR will
increase spool up but reduce top end performance.&nbsp; A larger AR will allow
more air to flow through its passages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I said &quot;everything else being equal&quot;.&nbsp; A/R
ratio is most useful when comparing flow capacities between like housings with
similar exterior dimensions and different size volutes. In other words, turbo A
with a .86 AR does not always flow more air than turbo B with a .64 AR.&nbsp;
Turbo A could be a 3 inch tall motorcycle tuyrbo and Turbo B could be a turbo 5 feet tall used in a power
plant.&nbsp; When comparing only AR ratio, the
housings must be otherwise identical.&nbsp; Some VW turbos are called K03, K04,
etc., this is only a general spec since there were many different K03 and K04
turbos and most of them are not suitable for a TDI.&nbsp; In other words, don't buy
a gasser VW turbo and bolt it onto your diesel because it won't work well.
</p>
<img border="0" src="../images/7cm_volute.jpg" align="right" width="350" height="326">
      The shape of the volute can also dramatically effect air flow because of
      how it directs the air.&nbsp; The closer to the shape of a teardrop the
      volute takes, the easier energy is transferred around the housing and into
      the turbine wheel.&nbsp; For example, Mitsubishi makes many turbos for
      many different applications.&nbsp; The 7cm Mitsubishi exhaust housing has
      a compromised volute (teardrop cut in half) for water line clearance to
      the bearing housing and ease of casting, pictured right.<p>You may also
      hear of twin scroll turbos.&nbsp; This is an exhaust housing divided
      into two volutes for four cylinder engines (or 4/bank on a V8).&nbsp; This is used with a
      divided exhaust manifold to separate the exhaust pulses from the cylinders
for smoother flow and maximize performance.</p>
<h3><a name="InternalvsExternal">Internal vs. External
wastegate</a></h3>
<p>The exhaust housing may also house an internal wastegate.&nbsp; An internal
wastegate is a passage cast into the exhaust housing with a flap door.&nbsp;
It's common for turbos to spin from 0-100,000+ rpm in a few seconds but if they
overspeed they can be damaged.&nbsp; The flap door lets exhaust gas bypass the
turbine and controls the speed and output of the turbo.</p>
<p>Below left is a housing that uses an external wastegate - because it's
external it's not part of the turbo.&nbsp; Below right is an internal wastegate
with dual doors from a Mitsubishi Evo.&nbsp; It has two doors to allow a larger
door within the space limits of the exhaust housing.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/externalwastegate.jpg" width="360" height="367"><img border="0" src="../images/evo_wastegate.jpg" width="501" height="356"></p>
<p>The wastegate door is is opened and closed by an external lever, visible
above, which is moved by a spring
loaded actuator.&nbsp; The wastegate actuator is basically a vacuum diaphragm
which normally closes the wastegate because the spring inside the wastegate
creates resistance on the lever which holds the door closed.&nbsp; Once the vacuum
diaphragm receives a certain amount of boost pressure, it overcomes the spring and
begins to open the wastegate.&nbsp; Once boost pressure falls back down, it
rapidly closes.&nbsp; One
method that chip tuners use to build power in turbodiesel cars is to reprogram
the car's computer to hold the wastegate closed at higher than stock pressures
to make more boost.&nbsp; On older gas cars this could be done by restricting
the amount of boost going to the wastegate which held it shut longer.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/turbowastegate.jpg" align="right" width="317" height="268">One
interesting thing about the turbos shown above is that their housing outlets
match the shape of their exhaust pipes.&nbsp; This is best for good exhaust
flow.&nbsp; Most turbos look like the one on the right - internal wastegate with
a single door and not matched.&nbsp; This space creates an empty spot where air
turbulence can form.&nbsp; Many newer turbos have built in dividers
and you can also make or buy an exhaust pipe with a divider to improve exhaust
flow.&nbsp; More on split downpipes in the sections below.</p>
<p>An external wastegate is superior to an internal wastegate in terms of boost
control and airflow.&nbsp; The piping exiting the exhaust housing can be made to
match the size and shape of the exhaust turbine, creating a smooth transition
from the turbo to the exhaust.&nbsp; This translates into more power everywhere
in the rpm range.&nbsp; However, it costs more in money and work since
you have to buy and route a separate wastegate.&nbsp; This extra exhaust pipe
routing also takes up more
space.&nbsp; A good compromise between an internal wastegate and
external wastegate is a split downpipe (see below for more details on downpipes).</p>
<p>Some new Borg Warner turbos have a new type of wastegate which is built into
the exhaust housing at an angle.&nbsp; This saves space and lets it approach the
efficiency of an external wastegate turbo.&nbsp; Below you can see how it looks
on the inside.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/borg-warner-efr-turbo.jpg" width="784" height="384"></p>
<p>Here you can see the angle that the door is placed on this new line of Borg
Warner EFR turbos.&nbsp; You can also see the wastegate actuator and lever.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/bw-efr-turbo-2.jpg" width="588" height="426"></p>
<p>Most modern engines also have a bypass valve or diverter valve that
redirects boost away from the engine and back into the intake when you close the
throttle.&nbsp; A blow off valve is similar but releases boost into the
atmosphere instead.&nbsp; TDI don't have these and can't use them because they don't
have throttles that work like that.</p>
<p>All modern TDI and many modern diesels don't even wastegates at all!&nbsp;
All VW TDI and Audi TDI
turbos, mk4 generation and newer, use a VNT mechanism and actuator instead.&nbsp;
On the outside a VNT actuator looks similar to a wastegate actuator but it works
off vacuum instead of pressure.&nbsp; The outside of the exhaust housing is also
thicker to house the VNT mechanism inside the turbo.&nbsp; The VNT also limits turbo speed
but instead of opening a bypass door, it redirects the exhaust gases at the turbine wheel
instead.&nbsp;
The other main purpose is to maximize exhaust energy through actuating the VNT
vanes to the optimum angle for a given amount of rpm and flow.&nbsp; See the
below section and videos for a detailed explanation.&nbsp; 1996-1999 3rd generation (mk3) VW TDI turbos use a conventional turbo
with an internal wastegate, all later generations used a VNT turbo.&nbsp; If the solenoid controlling
pressure/vac to the wastegate malfunctions, the default position is to open the
wastegate.&nbsp; This is because if it were to fail in the closed position, the
engine would create too much boost and incur serious damage.&nbsp; A
misdiagnosed &quot;failed turbo&quot; is often just limp mode, see <a href="multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">1000q:
diagnosing VW TDI limp mode</a> for more details.&nbsp; It can also freeze in
one position, causing low power.&nbsp; If you have constant low power, see <a href="multi/low-power-fix-TDI.htm">1000q:
constant low power</a>.&nbsp; To test or adjust the VNT actuator, see <a href="a4/VNT-wastegate-adjust.htm">1000q:
VNT check</a>.</p>
<h3><a name="turboexhaust">Turbo exhaust flow</a></h3>
<p>You want the least backpressure in the exhaust downstream of the turbo for maximum
performance, no exceptions.&nbsp; The problem is that you have to balance
maximum performance with emissions and difficulty/cost of fabrication, etc..&nbsp;
A non
turbo or supercharged cars may not have  maximum performance with the least backpressure because some backpressure may be produced as a byproduct of the best performing exhaust. Pipe diameter and design affects performance mostly because of how it affects exhaust pulse wave tuning and the scavenging effect from cylinders. A &quot;tuned&quot; exhaust can help pull the next exhaust pulse out of the engine which increases performance. This tuning can sometimes result in backpressure as a byproduct. This is why an exhaust that's too large can penalize non turbo cars, depending
on the application. Again, backpressure  itself is never desirable.</p>
<p> With turbo exhausts,
there is no
wave tuning because the turbo chops up the exhaust and it's making plenty of it's own energy waves. A turbo gets its energy by a pressure
ratio differential so you want the highest energy differential across the turbo (exhaust gasses have energy in both velocity and heat).&nbsp; This means you want the least backpressure
and highest velocity exhaust gases after the turbo.&nbsp; Image a waterwheel: you want the pressure highest before the
waterwheel and lowest after the waterwheel to transfer the most
energy to the waterwheel.</p>
<p>Manifold, turbo, and downpipe exhaust wraps and coatings may help performance.  These serve two main purposes: to keep energy in the exhaust stream
instead of passing it to the cast iron exhaust and to lower underhood
temperatures, both of which can increase performance.&nbsp; However, coatings also
reduce radiation and external convection which results in more heat being passed into the CHRA and
cylinder head.&nbsp; Some heat is carried away by cooler EGT when the engine is
off boost but it doesn't take a genius to know that insulation on
something hot makes it stay hot longer.</p>
<p>The easiest way to reduce backpressure is with a straight pipe exhaust,
meaning that the exhaust is a simple pipe after the turbo (not street
legal).&nbsp; How much power is released by putting a straight pipe exhaust on a TDI?&nbsp;
First, remember that total power is the area under a power curve, not just peak
power.&nbsp; You may not gain much peak power with only an exhaust change but
the total amount of power should slightly increase.&nbsp; A TDI diesel is throttled by fuel and uses a
relatively small turbo with computer controlled fueling.&nbsp; Increasing boost
will only cause <a href="multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">limp mode</a> because the
car's computer thinks something is wrong.&nbsp; However, less backpressure will
let the system work to their full potential so consider an exhaust as a basic supporting mod for any future modifications such as a chip, larger
turbos, fuel nozzles, etc.</p>
<p>Below are some more details on individual components of exhaust
systems.&nbsp; The ideal exhaust system would produce the least backpressure immediately after
the turbo.&nbsp; Due to routing, emissions equipment, pipe diameter, exhaust gas
temperatures/pressures, the perfect diameter changes from car to car, setup to
setup.&nbsp; It's very difficult to know this without extensive testing so as a
rough rule of thumb, a consistent or increasing diameter exhaust as you head downstream towards the
tailpipe is best in many cases.</p>
<p> Mandrel bent exhausts are
always better.&nbsp; A mandrel bend is when piping is bent with a mandrel, or
insert, to keep the inner diameter consistent at the bend.&nbsp; Crush bends
reduce the diameter at the bend and reduce smooth exhaust flow.&nbsp; Most
factory exhausts are non-mandrel bent crush style bends, so switching to a
mandrel bent exhaust will increase power and efficiency of the turbos and engine
with no other modifications.&nbsp; You also want to avoid very restrictive
mufflers, sharp changes in piping diameter, and sharp bends.&nbsp; As a rough
rule of thumb, a sharp 90<sup>o</sup> bend in the piping could have about the same
resistance to airflow as 25 feet of straight piping!</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/tumanifold.JPG" align="right" width="400" height="400">For an extreme level of modification, you could also switch to an equal
length runner exhaust manifold for the turbo (the part that is between the turbo
and cylinder head).&nbsp; Equal length runners make sure that the exhaust pulses
are timed so that they take the same amount of time to hit the turbine and to
keep cylinder reversion balanced across all cylinders. The stock VW exhaust
manifold and most stock turbo exhaust manifolds are the log style manifold.&nbsp; The log style is much cheaper and easier to
make and take up less room. It can also be more durable because it's cast in one piece of iron - without weak welds they can't easily crack with repeated heat cycling, expansion, vibration, the weight of
the turbo, and stress.&nbsp; In my opinion,  the amount of custom fabrication is  high (expensive) so  you'd see better results spending your money and time improving other areas  first.&nbsp; Most turbodiesel passenger cars serve as daily drivers
and are not yet at a level where a tubular manifold would be an economical power
upgrade.&nbsp; Here's a picture of a tubular header showing equal length exhaust runners.&nbsp; Since this article was
written, vendors have come out with aftermarket manifolds for the TDI.&nbsp;
Unless you have access to a high quality fabricator nearby, I would contact the
vendors directly to see what options they have.&nbsp; Here are direct links to
compare cast manifolds from from <a href="http://jsperformance.ca/product_info.php?cPath=57_139&amp;products_id=279">JSperformance</a>
or <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-60/A-VNT-dsh-20-turbo-exhaust/Detail">Kermatdi</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each appears slightly different in coatings or other
modifications so contact the vendor directly to see what they offer.&nbsp; Because you can just buy the part as a bolt on part instead of doing custom
fabrication, I would definitely suggest an upgraded manifold if you are upsizing
the turbo assuming that it is not an integrated manifold housing and budget permitting.&nbsp; See <a href="TDI-power-mods-chip-tune.htm">1000q:
basic performance upgrades for the TDI</a> for more details.</p>
<h3><a name="oemexhaust">Why change from your OEM exhaust
system?</a></h3>
<p>You may be wondering how much gain in exhaust flow you will gain over your
OEM exhaust.&nbsp; With a turbo engine, there will always be an increase in efficiency in switching
to a <u> quality</u> aftermarket exhaust.&nbsp; Unless you make a measurement of backpressure, there is no
quantitative way to know how much.&nbsp; Even two otherwise identical cars may be slightly different due
to manufacturing tolerances.&nbsp; Much like any other modification to your car,
custom parts will cost a lot more than if it were a mass produced part by an OEM
parts supplier making thousands of factory parts.&nbsp; All you can know for sure is that it
should be an
improvement over your OEM exhaust as long as the replacement parts are quality
pieces.&nbsp; One example is the  Hyundai Genesis 2.0T exhaust.&nbsp; There's a big crimp in the exhaust for support
brace clearance, shown below.&nbsp; Replacing
this piece would result in a small power and response gain with no other
modification.&nbsp; Because it looks like it's between a catalytic converter or
a muffler, any gain in
flow would be small but it adds up.<br>

<p>The OEM part has to conform to emissions and noise regulations that vary
country to country, be easily produced and fabricated thousands of times, and
may only be, as an example, 75% efficient.&nbsp; By replacing it with a part
that is 90% efficient, you might end up spending $$$.&nbsp; As a result, work
with your budget to reach your realistic power goals.&nbsp; If it's worth the money is
ultimately up to you, some people would rather spend
the money on something other than a car.</p>
<p>So why didn't your car maker just give you a 90% efficient exhaust?&nbsp; If all the parts on your car were one level better, it
would be a lot more expensive.&nbsp; If they
put all luxury car parts or premium sports car parts on an economy car, it wouldn't be an economy car
would it?</p>
<h3>Backpressure in the exhaust housing</h3>
<p>One way to test how much back pressure you have is to take a reading.&nbsp;
Tap the
exhaust system before the turbo with any pressure gauge.&nbsp; An oil pressure gauge
or low range air pressure gauge will both measure the backpressure in the
exhaust.&nbsp; I suggest putting an air filter or fuel filter inline to dampen
the exhaust pulses so you can get a steady measurement.&nbsp; Once you hit
boost, note the peak hold value.&nbsp; Once the pressure has peaked, you have
reached the engine's max VE.&nbsp; As a rule of thumb for performance applications, you don’t want more than a 1:1.5 ratio of boost to backpressure.&nbsp;
Practically all street cars will make more backpressure than boost. As a rough example, if you are making 10psi of boost you don't want more than 15-18 psi of
backpressure. If so, then the turbine side could benefit from more air flow and you’ll make
more horsepower for every pound of boost you run.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the
turbo wheels are not easily changed except by turbo rebuilding professionals, so
for most car setups, the basic rule of thumb should be:&nbsp;<p>Between the exhaust
ports and the turbine housing, you want as much energy going through that
turbo.&nbsp; This means metals that don't soak up the heat, heat
reflecting coatings, short piping, and tubular headers.&nbsp; Keep in mind that
if the turbine housing can't flow enough air, the effect of these improvements will be
lessened.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that while an exhaust
manifold made from stainless steel can be welded into to a better flowing
manifold, it will get red hot if driven hard and will be more prone to
cracking at the welds compared to a cast iron manifold.
<p>After the turbine
housing, you want the greatest heat and pressure differential.&nbsp; This means a  free flow exhaust.&nbsp; Test pipes or
straight exhausts would be considered more or less free flow exhausts.
<h3><a name="Test pipes">Test pipes vs. catalytic converters and the biodiesel clogging effect</a></h3>
<p>Tests pipes are basically pipes that replace the section of exhaust that
contains the catalytic converters.&nbsp; It is for off-road use only and is
illegal in every state!&nbsp; In fact, removing the catalytic converters and the
O2 sensors will cause error codes to appear in many cars, especially obd2+ cars.&nbsp; OBD2+
gasoline cars often have an O2 sensor before and after the catalytic
converter.&nbsp; VW diesels did not use an O2 sensor in the exhaust
except 2004-2006 pumpe cars and newer TDI.&nbsp; If
removed and not worked around with a chip or resistor, it sets a check engine light and can cause a
failure of
any required emissions testing or inspections, preventing you
from registering your car in some states.&nbsp; There are also fines for removing or tampering
with factory emissions equipment on cars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there are so many negatives to test pipes, then why do many people use
them?&nbsp; Power and economy are both increased with test pipes, especially in
turbo engines.&nbsp; In designing a turbo system, the engineers want to have the
highest energy differential before and after the turbine wheel.&nbsp; This
energy (exhaust gas velocity, heat, pressure) differential transfers energy to the
turbo system.&nbsp; By removing the catalytic converters and that restriction in the
exhaust system, you create a greater pressure differential&nbsp;across the turbo and let
it work &quot;easier&quot;.&nbsp; Keep in mind that this is
for turbo cars only!&nbsp; Non-turbo or supercharged cars do not have turbos and
the potential performance gains are not as great with test pipes and  the manufacturer has  spent lots of time engineering optimal exhaust systems given their constraints.</p>
<p>Another factor is that while the catalytic converters act as
a restriction in exhaust flow, they do add energy and velocity by burning off
unburned hydrocarbons in an exothermic oxidation.&nbsp; This is still not enough
to overcome their restriction in flow, but it's not like stuffing a potato in
the exhaust pipe if that's the kind of restriction you were imagining.&nbsp; A catalytic converter
is actually honeycombed or grid-like in structure and allows exhaust to flow through it.</p>
<p> I would recommend leaving the catalytic converters in
place.&nbsp; Leaving the catalytic converters in place will both clean the
exhaust emissions, make the exhaust much cleaner and quieter, and is less
expensive than making custom piping.&nbsp; It's almost impossible for a car to pass emissions
testing without
catalytic converters.&nbsp; The TDI is an excellent daily driver
and I didn't want to tolerate the increased smoke, odor, and emissions for the
trade off in power and turbo response.&nbsp; Anyways, chip tuning is a bigger factor in throttle
response in a TDI because of the electronic throttle and fueling.&nbsp; If you want an all out sports car,
the TDI will not satisfy you and if it does, you never wanted a real sports car
or don't know what a real sports car is like.&nbsp; In the end, it's your
car.&nbsp; Another reason to bypass the exhaust
filters is if you are using <a href="biodiesel/biodiesel.htm">biodiesel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="biodiesel/biodiesel.htm">Biodiesel</a>, especially homebrew or contaminated biodiesel may cause the newest
generation of diesel exhaust filters (DPF) to become clogged with
particulates.&nbsp; Up to 5% biodiesel is allowed by the TDI warranty.&nbsp;
Unlike a catalytic converter which lets gasses and particulates pass through it,
DPF are block off filters which let gases pas through but trap particulates and
solids.&nbsp; When exhaust
backpressure from particulates clog the filter, the car's computer
dramatically raises the exhaust gas temperatures with post combustion injection
at the cylinder to burn off the particulates
and self clean the filters.&nbsp; Hard and hot runs will reduce regen cycles by
naturally increasing the burn off and
short trips/cold starts will increase the regen cycles.&nbsp; Biodiesel could potentially
cause excess regen or filter clogging.&nbsp;&nbsp; Long term experiences with
real world TDI drivers and homebrew are not yet known.&nbsp; Homebrew biodiesel may put excessive byproducts and unreacted chemicals into the filters and cause them to
clog.&nbsp; This is also a problem if you use the older non ultra low sulphur
fuel, no longer available in the USA or Europe but still used in some parts of
the world like Mexico.&nbsp; The filter is what gives petrol diesel such low emissions and the irony is that
biodiesel is already a low emissions fuel.</p>

<p>Below is a picture of what a quality test pipe might look like.&nbsp; Some
curves are necessary due to packaging but it should be relatively straight with
gradual curves.&nbsp; A resonator is
welded on the left side to help quiet any droning resonating &quot;booming&quot;
noise that many
free flow exhausts will make at certain rpm.&nbsp; A louvered resonator causes
turbulence and reduces exhaust flow but is quieter than a perforated hole resonator which has
little effect
on flow but is not as quiet.&nbsp; Remember that loud = tickets and a catalytic
converter is the best way to reduce emissions and keep the exhaust on the quiet
side.</p>
<p>A common complaint with free flow straight pipe exhausts is exhaust
resonation noise.&nbsp; In fact, many people have it but don't acknowledge it
because they think it's just loud or actually like it.&nbsp; Some people like
loud neon green paint jobs too but at least bystanders can look away.&nbsp; Resonation differs
from loudness because it has a certain boominess, rattling, buzzing, or hollow
vibration sound at certain RPM vs. just being loud.&nbsp; There are many possible
causes but the most common ways to get rid of it are to install a venturi and a resonator at
strategic positions along the exhaust, controlling flutter of the exhaust by
smoothing out sharp corners in the exhaust or downpipe, or slowing the exhaust
velocity by installing a catalytic converter (also makes overall sound quieter).&nbsp;
Pictured below is a venturi. Splicing it into the exhaust at the correct spot
can reduce resonation noise.<br>

<h3>The DPF diesel particulate filter</h3>
<p>All TDI after 2009 (and 2006-2008 VW Touareg TDI) have diesel particulate
filters (DPF).&nbsp; This is a soot filter downstream of the catalytic converter
that captures soot and burns it out during a self clean cycle.&nbsp; It's not
possible to bypass the DPF on your VW TDI or remove the DPF on TDI engines
because there are a number of pressure and temperatures sensors that expect to
see proper operation of the DPF.&nbsp; For detailed information on the DPF
system, see <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: DPF FAQ</a>.&nbsp;
V6 VW/Audi TDI,
BMW, and Mercedes all use a &quot;wet&quot; urea system with Adblue fluid for
NOx emissions.&nbsp; See <a href="vw-touareg-tdi-dpf-audi-q7.htm">1000q: Adblue&nbsp;w/DPF
FAQ</a> for information on the wet systems. 4 cylinder TDI have a slightly different no-Adblue fluid
system except for the heavier Passat TDI.</p>
<h3><a name="splitdownpipe">The downpipe - split and
single pipe</a></h3>
<p>A downpipe is the exhaust pipe immediately after the turbo.&nbsp; It could
also be called an up-pipe but due to the configuration of most engines, the
exhaust is normally directed down after exiting the turbo.&nbsp; It's normally a
single pipe that collects the exhaust from both the turbine output and wastegate
output.&nbsp; From the earlier pictures, you can see that there is also a lot of
empty room for exhaust gases to become turbulent upon exiting the turbine in an
internal wastegate housing.&nbsp;
When the wastegate opens, the tumbling exhaust coming out of the wastegate
collides with the spinning air exiting the turbine.&nbsp; This area of
turbulence saps power because the air downstream of the turbine isn't moving
smoothly and as fast as it could be.&nbsp; This problem is not a factor for housings
without an internal wastegate, like external wastegate turbos and VNT
turbos.&nbsp; Some turbos even have the
initial section of downpipe as part of the exhaust housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of a horrible downpipe is the mk3 TDI's piece.&nbsp; The wastegate
exhaust flow hits a solid plate and crashes 90<sup>o</sup> into the exhaust stream leaving
the turbine.&nbsp; Since TDI turbos are small and spool up quickly, the
wastegate opens pretty early and causes turbulence for much of the rpm
range.&nbsp; You can see the soot marks where the turbo exhaust flows.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/badwast.jpg" width="613" height="390"></p>
<p>Another difference between your TDI downpipe and gasoline downpipe is that
your TDI downpipe is just a pipe while gasoline car downpipes have a small
catalytic converter immediately downstream of the turbo because of emissions.&nbsp; The cast iron manifold and turbo absorb heat and can quadruple the time
for the catalytic converter to heat up and start cleaning emissions.&nbsp; 90%
of a modern car's emissions are during cold start and the small catalytic converter is
needed to take care of these emissions.&nbsp; While removing it is illegal and
will make your car's emissions much worse, removal will make a big difference in turbo
response.</p>
<p>A split downpipe is a downpipe with two separated pipes, one for the turbine exhaust, and one
for the wastegate exhaust.&nbsp; It may have a machined separator for the empty
space between the turbine outlet and wastegate or a section of pipe.&nbsp; By smoothing out the
airflow, it enhances airflow all throughout the rpm range.&nbsp; The two split
pipes then rejoin down the exhaust path.&nbsp; Here are some pictures of split
downpipes.&nbsp; One has a split that is longer than the other.&nbsp; The point of diminishing returns is
about 12&quot;-18&quot; for uninterrupted flow before rejoining the wastegate
piping to the main exhaust flow.&nbsp; The second picture below also has detail of the machined wastegate separator at one end instead
of using a section of pipe to separate the exhaust streams like in the first
picture below.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/supersplit.jpg" width="427" height="295">&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../images/splitdp.jpg" width="354" height="229"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/expansplit.jpg" align="right" width="640" height="448">This last downpipe pictured is also slightly different in that it has an expansion
chamber, a chamber where the diameter of the piping expands as you go downstream.&nbsp;
A gradual
expansion at the turbine outlet via a straight conical diffuser of about 7-12° is
ideal, depending on factors such as space within the engine bay, exhaust gas
velocity, temperature, and volume.&nbsp; Too great or too abrupt of a
transition, and you get flow separation and turbulence, reducing flow.&nbsp;
Ideally, the best flow would be achieved by a trumpet shaped
downpipe that exits into an area below the car, but this is obviously not legal
or safe because of exhaust noise and the exhaust fumes that would surround and leak
into the cabin.&nbsp; You want the highest exhaust velocity after the turbine, and while bigger
normally equals better, too large of an exhaust or bad routing could cool the exhaust, reduce
its velocity, and create excess backpressure.&nbsp; A side effect of a more
gradual expansion and wastegate pipe is that it sounds much smoother than a some
pipes
which have resonation at certain rpm due to the fluttering of the exhaust.</p>
<p>These downpipes all have O2 sensor bungs welded in them because they are for
gasoline cars, but the same ideas apply to diesel cars.&nbsp; Keep in mind that many diesel
turbos and all newer TDI do not have wastegates.&nbsp; They use variable nozzles
(VNT) within the exhaust housing
to control turbo speeds.&nbsp; Without a wastegate, an excellent downpipe would
be a straight tube or trumpet like the below picture except without the smaller
wastegate pipe.&nbsp; The welds are ground down on the inside to smooth
out the flow as the pipe diameter gradually increases.</p>
Lastly, some newer turbos have a divider
      already built into the exhaust
      housing to be
used with a matching downpipe.&nbsp; Here is an example from a Mitsubishi
Evolution, a high performance turbo gasoline car.&nbsp; It uses two wastegate doors and a
      divorced exhaust housing matched to the downpipe.
      <p>Some exhaust housings don't fully separate the exhaust and wastegate
      streams and leave a small gap.&nbsp; This is fine because it still separates most of the air and
      allows some spillover.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      <img border="0" src="../images/evo_wastegate.jpg" width="501" height="356"></p>
<h3>
      <a name="Variableturbo">Variable geometry VNT turbo vs. fixed geometry turbo</a></h3>
<p>Many turbodiesel engines feature variable vane, variable geometry, or variable
nozzle technology that is only now being
used in gasoline engines.&nbsp; A gasoline engine's sustained exhaust temperatures are higher than
in a diesel, which resulted in damage and short lifespans for early gasoline variable
turbos during the 1980s.&nbsp; Gasoline
engines also require the turbo to be more efficient over a larger range of rpm
as compared to a diesel engine.&nbsp; Today,
advances in turbo design and metallurgy have made these turbos more reliable on both gasoline
and diesel cars, although only one gasoline car, the newest Porsche 911 turbo,
currently uses it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Variable vane, variable geometry, or variable nozzle technology change the angle
which the exhaust pushes against the exhaust turbine.&nbsp; This greatly reduces
lag while keeping top end power.&nbsp; It combines the fast spool of a small
turbo with the flow capacity of a larger turbo.&nbsp; Different types of
variable turbos have different ways of accomplishing this with vanes or
nozzles.&nbsp; By optimizing
the speed and angle of the exhaust moving through the exhaust housing and
hitting the turbine, it maximizes the efficiency of the turbo.&nbsp; By keeping
the turbo speed higher over a greater range, it produces more low end power with sustained top end with about equal amounts of airflow compared
to a traditional turbo.&nbsp; This VW turbodiesel engines mk4 (4th generation) and
newer, starting in 1998 with the New Beetle all use a variable geometry
turbocharger.</p>
<p>Below are 2 youtube movies showing how it works.&nbsp; There's a vacuum can
which moves a lever in the exhaust side of the turbo hosing.&nbsp; Vacuum is
being applied to the can, not pressure.&nbsp; To see disassembly of a VNT turbo
on a ALH engine TDI, see <a href="a4/VNT-turbo-removal-vanes.htm">1000q:

</p>
<h3>Turbo lag</h3>
<p> The period between
pushing on the throttle pedal and feeling the rush of acceleration is commonly
referred to as lag.&nbsp; Lag is a symptom of the time it takes for the exhaust
turbine wheel to overcome its rotational inertia and for the intake impeller to
create boost.&nbsp; Just remember that although
it changes the feeling of the power curve, a turbo car usually makes more power
over every part of the power curve compared to an identical non turbo car's
engine.</p>
<p>A higher compression engine reduces lag.&nbsp; Lag can be reduced at the
turbo by lowering the rotational inertia of the turbine or by
use of ball bearings.&nbsp; Manufacturers may use lighter parts such as ceramic turbo wheels to allow
faster spool-up.&nbsp; Another way to reduce lag is
to change the aspect ratio of the turbine by reducing the diameter and
increasing the gas-flow path-length.&nbsp; The best way to reduce lag in a VW
TDI is through the chip tuning and reducing pumping losses through improved
intake and exhaust piping.&nbsp; Moving from a VNT turbo to an aftermarket non
VNT will increase lag since the non VNT TDI turbos are all large compared to the
VNT turbos.&nbsp; Click <a href="tditurbo.htm">1000q: TDI turbo upgrade chart</a>
to see what's available.</p>
<p> The current trend for high performance turbos are
billet turbo wheels instead of cast wheels.&nbsp; Everything else being equal,
this does not increase performance.&nbsp; Here is the <a href="http://www.turbobygarrett.com/turbobygarrett/news/race_updates/Garrett_Fully_Machined.html">reference
from Garrett</a>.&nbsp; The reason turbo wheels are machined instead of cast is
because it's cheaper to make low volume parts by machining them instead of making
the casts and because the wheel can be made stronger.&nbsp; One reason why most
billet turbos in the car aftermarket are an improvement is because they use
newer wheel designs.&nbsp; If the wheel can be made lighter, it will increase
turbo response.</p>
<p>Gamma Titanium Aluminide turbine wheels are showing up on turbos from cutting
edge applications on jet engines.&nbsp; Lighter turbine wheels mean up to 50%
lighter weight vs. inconel.</p>
<h3><a name="CHRA&nbsp;">The CHRA</a></h3>
<p>The center housing rotating assembly (CHRA) is the center section that contains the
bearings which hold the main shaft connecting the intake and exhaust wheels and the
coolant and oil lines.&nbsp; There are some new turbos which can handle greater
mounting angles but almost all turbos are mounted with the shafts parallel to
the ground so that there are no excess loads and that the oil drains properly
out of the housing.&nbsp; Older turbos use bronze journal bearings, a
machined bronze cylinder to hold the main shaft.&nbsp; Much like a crankshaft
bearing, it is lubricated generously by
oil from the engine and held in place by a thrust bearing.&nbsp; While
pressurized by oil, the journal bearing is floating and spinning on a layer of
oil.&nbsp; Some newer turbos use
chromium/carbon steel ball bearings to hold the main
shaft.&nbsp; The fastest turbos use ceramic ball bearings which can handle significantly
higher safe operating rpm than comparable steel ball bearings.</p>
<p>The advantages of ball bearings include better damping and control over shaft
motion.&nbsp; In addition, the opposed angular contact bearing cartridge
eliminates the need for a thrust bearing, a common source of damage and oil
leaks.&nbsp; Ball bearings also spool faster and harder compared to an identical
journal bearing at the same rpm.&nbsp; There is reduced
drag on the turbo shaft which increases performance and can be felt.&nbsp; Ball bearings also require much less oil to provide adequate lubrication than a journal bearing turbo.&nbsp; This lower
oil volume also reduces the chance for seal leakage.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/oillinejet.jpg" align="right" width="279" height="179">But
if they receive too much
oil, ball bearings will actually skid in their races, creating wear in one spot which damages the bearings.&nbsp;
As a generic recommendation, if you exchange your
old journal bearing turbo for a new BB turbo you must change the oil lines or
install a restrictor to prevent smoke due to excess oil leaking out the exhaust side.&nbsp; To the right is a picture of a journal bearing
banjo bolt vs. replacement banjo bolt oil feed restrictor for a ball bearing
turbo.&nbsp; The journal bearing oil
line is the larger diameter one - as you can see, there is a massive difference
in the required oiling vs. the small
hole on the ball bearing!</p>
<p>On a side note, excess crankcase pressures from clogged vents and too little
backpressure can cause some turbos to smoke, especially with worn seals.&nbsp;
Obviously worn seals will cause smoking but it can be made worse if there's
pressure in the crankcase.&nbsp; Without the catalytic converter and other
things that can create some backpressure to counteract the crankcase pressure,
it's easier for oil to get past the seals.&nbsp; Crankcase pressure also causes
the oil drain line flow to slow which makes the problem worse.&nbsp; TDI have a
vacuum pump to run the various car systems which exits into the crankcase so
it's very important for the crank case vent (CCV) system to be clear.&nbsp;
Unlike gas cars which have a PCV valve, the CCV system is pretty much always
pumping out air.</p>
<p>The most problematic part of a turbo is normally the CHRA.&nbsp; The intake
and exhaust housings are just nonmoving cast metal housings.&nbsp; They generally do not
get damaged unless the exhaust side is overheated and cracks, breaks an inlet or
outlet flange, or damage to the
exhaust transmits force to the exhaust housing and cracks it. The turbine blades
generally do not get break unless a foreign object falls into the
turbo or air intake.&nbsp; But a worn or damaged CHRA can allow shaft play and
damage the turbines.&nbsp; Below is a non VNT conventional turbo
disassembled.&nbsp; Note the ball bearing instead of journal bearings and damage
to the compressor wheel.&nbsp; A ball bearing is not rebuildable, the most
reliable way to reuse your old turbo is to reuse the old cast iron housings with
a brand new CHRA and components.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/disasmall.jpg" width="640" height="393"></p>
<p>To see removal of a CHRA from the housings, see <a href="a4/VNT-turbo-removal-vanes.htm">1000q:
VNT vane removal and cleaning</a>.&nbsp; Most Garrett turbos use a machined fit
on the housings.&nbsp; Under very high turbo boost, some turbos will leak at the
machined fit.&nbsp; Removal of the housing, machining of the compressor back
plate, and installation of an o-ring can help fix a leak there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a name="turborunaway">The turbo runaway in a diesel engine</a></h3>
<p>Another&nbsp;problem with the CHRA is that the oil can leak out from worn
seals and cause a runaway engine.&nbsp; The turbo runaway is a variation of the diesel
engine runaway.&nbsp; Older turbos use a 270<sup>o</sup> thrust bearing
on the compressor side that holds the
journal bearing in place.&nbsp; Some newer types use a 360<sup>o</sup> thrust bearing
that is a little better because they distribute the
load across a wider area - see below for a picture comparing them (not a TDI
engine).&nbsp; Most VNT turbos use a 360<sup>o</sup>
 bearing.&nbsp; I wouldn't worry
about the bearings used in the TDI since the difference in wear is marginal.&nbsp; With proper care and
synthetic oil, the thrust bearing can last the life of the turbo.&nbsp;
However, excessive thrust movement and pressures (caused by manufacturing issues,
bad oil, or worn
bearings) can cause excessive wear and play and can let oil leak out.&nbsp;
Because diesel engines can run on engine oil, and diesels are throttled by fuel,
too much oil in the intake will cause the engine to race and suck out more
engine to burn, resulting in a nasty feedback cycle.&nbsp; Please see <a href="stop-runaway-diesel-engine-how-to.htm"> 1000q:
runaway engine FAQ</a> and suggestions for details and more explanations.<br>

<p>If this or any other unintended or unexplained acceleration occurs, <u>the
driver's first priorities are to concentrate
on safe operation of the vehicle, keep it under control through braking and
steering input, and to regain control over engine power or shut the engine off
as soon as is safe and practical.</u>&nbsp; Pull the car over to the side of the
road only as soon as it's safe to do so.</p>
