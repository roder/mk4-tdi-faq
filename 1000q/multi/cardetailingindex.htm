<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b>
<p>Congratulations on getting a new (or at least new to you) car.&nbsp; This
section details with interior and exterior car detailing and care.&nbsp; Why take
car of your car?&nbsp; It enhances resale value, looks nicer, and helps prevent
damage due to corrosion and oxidation.&nbsp; If you just bought a used car, you would be surprised by how much
cleaner it will look with a through cleaning.&nbsp; Since the interior and
exterior are the parts of the car that you touch and look at the most, proper
care and restoration will really enhance your enjoyment of your car.&nbsp; If you are about to sell
your car, which do you think is more likely to sell for a higher price: a
dirty car or a clean car?&nbsp;</p>

below, click to enlarge) and the <a href="sunroof-drain-recall-VW-Audi.htm">
sunroof drains</a> (since recalled), that can cause rust or water leaks if they are not cleaned.<br>

<p><a href="washwax.htm">Washing/waxing your car</a><br>
You cannot wash and wax your car too many times.&nbsp; But too little or
improper washing and waxing can cause damage, see this article for some tips to
prevent damage.</p>

<p><a href="how-to-polish-paint-porter-cable.htm">Polishing your paint/swirl mark removal<br>
</a>Improper washing, automated car washes with dirty brushes, or just normal oxidation can put swirl marks
and scratches into the paint. Polishing your paint
removes these scratches.&nbsp; If you're not convinced, see the pics inside.</p>

<p><a href="clay-bar-paint.htm">Clay bar treatment</a><br>
Run your hand over your clean and freshly washed or waxed car's paint.&nbsp; Is
it rough or smooth as glass?&nbsp; After waxing, you may notice that your towels
are dirty even though you just washed the car.&nbsp; Clay bar treatment will
pull the dirt out that is stuck in the paint, that you previously have been
sealing in with wax.</p>

<p><a href="sticker-removal-paint.htm">Sticker, tar, gum, and dealer badge removal</a><br>
Don't like bumper stickers?&nbsp; Don't use scrubby pads, use this method to safely
clean them off.</p>

<p><a href="how-to-polish-foggy-headlight-lenses-kit-review.htm">Headlight polishing</a><br>
Glass headlight lenses are no longer used in non-sealed beam headlights due to
safety regulations.&nbsp; The stock plastic headlight lenses will pit and
oxidize with age and wear.&nbsp; Polishing can make the lenses more clear again.</p>

<p><a href="wax-stain-trim-removal.htm">Wax stain removal&nbsp;</a><br>
You probably have white stains on the trim from wax or aging.&nbsp; Using this
method will restore black trim to a nice black color and get rid of those
stains.</p>

</a>Some general tips on taking care of leather, cloth, and cleaning the
interior.</p>
<hr>
<p><b><font size="4">Supplies:</font></b></p>

<p>At the most basic, the supplies you will need are microfiber towels, a soft
washcloth/sponge/mitt, auto soap, and wax/wax applicators, and 2 buckets for
washing.&nbsp; Some other supplies I recommend are the porter cable random
orbital polisher with a variety of polishing pads and compounds, tire cleaners,
low-adhesion painter's tape for the rubber trim and weather stripping, and rain-x
rain repellant for glass.&nbsp; If you have these, you will be able to take care
of all your own car detailing. If you have dents, you can also get a
&quot;ding-king&quot; or &quot;pops-a-dent&quot; suction cup/glue dent
pullers.&nbsp; They help reduce the appearance of minor dents and dings, but
don't use them on a repainted car or they may pull the paint off.&nbsp; These
products also don't work as well as a experienced paintless dent removal
professional, but they are also a lot cheaper too.</p>

<p>Pictured is a porter cable random orbital polisher, 1 wash bucket, 1 chenille
sponge, 2 polishing pads, and 1 microfiber cloth.&nbsp; I also suggest a few
more cloths and 1 rinse bucket.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Microfiber towels</font></b><br>
Before I learned a lot about
car detailing, I just used paper towels and old cloths on my car.&nbsp; Paper
towels are made from wood pulp and can cause micro scratches in paint.&nbsp; Old clothes don't hold very much water and don't do a good job at
buffing and can contain synthetic fibers that can cause scratches.&nbsp; Microfiber towels are towels whose fiber cross-sections are
star shaped instead of round.&nbsp; This holds much more water and holds dirt
particles in suspension, whereas old clothes would just scrape them across the
surface, adding micro scratches. Microfiber is suitable for all surfaces and is
the best product for car paint and glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plush microfiber towels at Costco look pretty decent.&nbsp; Cheapo ebay or autozone microfiber towels are more suited for
cleaning glass or trim.&nbsp; They are great for household use but they are not
the best for auto paint because they have hard
plastic stitches and tags, and shed loose fibers.&nbsp; The best towels have
a plush construction and edgeless stitching.&nbsp; If you are still not
convinced, I used to use a wet paper
towel to clean the dust off my television until I tried a swiffer cloth.&nbsp;
If anyone has used a swiffer cloth, they know what I am talking about - it's the
difference between a long job that requires two passes to get it done and a
quick job that
takes less time and creates less mess.&nbsp; That is the difference
between using old pajamas and using good quality microfiber cloths.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p> <b><font size="4">Porter cable random orbit polisher</font></b><br>
This is the only real tool you need to start doing auto detailing.&nbsp; It is sold under a variety of labels (meguiar's) and model numbers, but they all
look like in the above picture.&nbsp; Do not confuse it with a single axis
rotary buffer.&nbsp; Rotary
buffers rotate on a single axis and are much more likely to damage your paint
due to uneven polishing.&nbsp; Unlike the cheapo 10&quot; large random orbit polisher you
can find at discount stores, the porter cable has a large, dual axis orbit and
freewheels on a bearing.&nbsp; The 10&quot; orbital polishers do not have a very
good motion and you will find that they are not very effective at anything other
than removing wax.&nbsp; It effectively mimics hand polishing but 1000 times
faster.
</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Polishing pads</font></b></p>
<p>These are accessories for the porter cable random orbit polisher.&nbsp; Can
be found on ebay or an internet search.&nbsp; They come in different colors but
I can't list them here because different pad makers use different colors for
different grades.&nbsp; You really only need soft, polish, and medium.&nbsp; You
only need heavy cutting pads if your car has bad paint with some very noticeable
scratches.</p>
<p>The grades come in:&nbsp;<br>
Softest - this is for waxing or removing wax, no cutting action<br>
Polishing - this is for polishing paint.&nbsp; It can be used with either
polishing compound or light rubbing compounds for machine use.<br>
Medium cutting - for heavy polishing compounds or rubbing compounds<br>
Heavy cutting - for use with rubbing compounds , faster cutting action, the roughest
pad.</p>
<p>Even though &quot;heavy cutting&quot; makes it sound like sandpaper, it is
still much less abrasive than even 2000 grit sandpaper (very light).&nbsp; Heavy
cutting is for use after wetsanding paint or removing noticeable scratches.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Mother's powerball</font></b></p>
<p>This is a buffing ball that fits onto your cordless drill.&nbsp; Use the mini
size for spot polishing of metal or headlights.&nbsp; For paint, use the
powerball for paint.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Polishing/rubbing compounds</font></b></p>
<p>I like &quot;3m finesse it&quot; because they work very well.&nbsp; Other common names are
meguiars, mothers, poorboys, they all work great.&nbsp; Turtle wax also works great but I don't like
their polishing or rubbing compounds for machine use.&nbsp; The turtle wax polish and rubbing
compounds tend to be much harder than the other brands because I suspect that
they were designed for hand use.&nbsp; Turtle wax polish is only slightly softer than
3m rubbing compound, and turtle wax rubbing compound (in the red plastic can) is so heavy
and rought that it's for hand use only!</p>

<p>A good set of basic supplies.&nbsp; Turtle wax rubbing and polishing compound
for hand use.&nbsp; 3m polish, rubbing, and wax for machine use.&nbsp; Armor all
car wash and (not pictured) armor all for the interior.&nbsp; See the polishing
paint article for a longer list of supplies.</p>
