<h2>This article shows how to DIY a DSG fluid drain and change, also shown is
VAS6262 tool</h2>

<p>The DSG transmission requires a fluid and filter change every 40,000 miles.&nbsp;
In addition to lubricating the gears, the twin clutches are lubricated by the
fluid.&nbsp; Some people report smoother shifting after a fluid change.&nbsp; S-tronic
is just Audi's name for the exact same transmission.&nbsp; This page shows a 6
speed 02e transverse DSG.&nbsp; If you have a 7 speed DSG your clutches are dry
but you still use fluid.&nbsp; These were not sold in North America.&nbsp; For technical information on the DSG transmission, see <a href="../DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
DSG and S-tronic FAQ</a>.</p>

<h3>Factory fill method vs. measure-refill method of adding fluid to the DSG
transmission</h3>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/old-dsg-fluid.jpg" align="right" alt="old dsg fluid" width="409" height="400">Both the factory fill method and measure-refill method are listed in the
procedure section.&nbsp; Professional VW specialists who have serviced well over 100 DSG
transmissions say that the measure-refill method works even better than the
factory method because the factory method often results in the fluid level being
up a little bit too low.&nbsp; In other words, even with a level car, he always
drains 4.5 L and only adds back about 4.0 L if using the factory method.&nbsp;
Other people have
done it the factory way and reported that only a little bit of fluid came out
after adding 4.5 L back in.&nbsp; It's unlikely that all the
transmissions are overfilled from the factory so this must mean that the
measure-refill method is just more consistent.&nbsp; It's your transmission and your decision which method
to follow.</p>

<p>No matter the method you use, the car must be level or else the fluid level
will be off!</p>

<p>The measure-refill method is: measure how much you drain and if it's 4.5
liters (+/- 0.1L) your transmission isn't leaking or overfilled.&nbsp; Then just
add back the same amount plus another 0.1 L to account for the filter and filter
housing.&nbsp; This does not waste
any fluid.&nbsp; To accurately measure how much fluid was drained, I used a
measuring cup and water to label a waste bottle.&nbsp; In the picture right, a
little over 4.3 was drained from the pan plus some out of the filter
housing.&nbsp; Paul Newman would probably approve.</p>

<p>The factory method is explained in more detail below and is shown in the
video.&nbsp; It can result in
wasting about .5-1.5 liters of fluid depending on how much you add.&nbsp; It
also <u> requires</u> use of a VCDS tool to measure the fluid temperature.&nbsp; This is
because as the fluid warms up it expands.&nbsp; If the fluid is too warm, too
much will overflow out the plastic snorkel insert and your fluid will be too
low.</p>

<p>The other drawback of this method is that if your car was just driven, the
fluid will be much to warm.&nbsp; This is fine for
draining but you must check the level beginning at a fluid temperature of 35<sup>o</sup>C
(95<sup>o</sup>F) and be done no higher than 45<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; Cooler is better due to the
level error mentioned earlier.&nbsp; You will probably have to wait a little bit
for the car to cool down before adding fresh fluid.&nbsp; Once the engine is
running, the fresh fluid will absorb heat from the transmission once it circulates
around.&nbsp; On a warm engine, the fluid will warm up quickly even if it's just
idling.</p>

<p>There is no dipstick on the transmission.</p>

<p>Only about 4.5 liters is changed through the drain plug during this
service.&nbsp; If you opened the transmission case and drained ALL the fluid, a
fresh fill is a little over 6.5 liters.</p>

<h3>The difference between VAS6262 and VAS6262a for DSG fluid and a DIY fill
tool </h3>

<p>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/ATF16DSG.jpg" align="right" alt="assenmacher ast dsg adapter atf16dsg" width="326" height="200">The manual says that VAS6262 fill tool is required but because of the
cost (~ $200 after ship),
you can make your own using a drilled out spare drain plug VW# n 902 154 04 (n902 154 04) and
a
hose/funnel.&nbsp; You can also tap the cap from one of the fluid bottles to
make a replica of the VAS6262 if you don't want to use a funnel.&nbsp; A DIY VAS 6262 will
cost around $30.&nbsp; If you don't want to drill and tap a spare drain plug, you
can buy an Assenmacher AST DSG adapter (ATF16DSG shown below, about $35) and some
hoses and clamps.&nbsp; The adapter on the OEM tools look the same as the
Assenmacher adapter.&nbsp; The threads on the drain plug or adapter are 24 mm x1.5.</p>

<p>If you don't want to make your own tool, you can also just refill the
transmission through the filter hole on the top.&nbsp; It's a small hole and
will take at least 40 minutes for it to drain.&nbsp; A top fill is slower but
cleaner than using VAS6262 or equivalent.&nbsp; The reason dealers use this tool
is because it's much faster to fill the transmission this way and time is money.</p>

<p>VAS 6262 is the original tool and has a valve at the cap end which I think
lets air in.&nbsp; VAS 6262a is the newer part number and has that long u shaped
metal tube to let air into the bottle.&nbsp; My guess is that it leaks less at
the cap valve.&nbsp; I think that VAS6262 can leak if you point it with
&quot;dead end side&quot; of the cap valve pointing down.&nbsp; Tilt the bottle
so that the fluid goes down the tube, not out the dead end side.&nbsp; A DIY DSG
fluid tool, 6262, and 6262a are functionally identical. (click to enlarge)<br>

You're not applying a high torque and if you're worried about stripping the drain you're doing it wrong.</p>

<h3>DIY DSG fluid change procedure shown on VW Jetta TDI</h3>

<p>A mk5 Jetta is shown but mk6 cars are the same.&nbsp; There were DSG transmissions
available in the mk4 New Beetle TDI so refer to the mk4 FAQ section for any
small differences like fluid capacity if you have a Beetle.&nbsp; The video below does not give all
detail so please read the entire page here before attempting this on your car.<br><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/tBYQnjur_wg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br></p>

<p>Raise the car by the jack points shown in your factory service manual and
rest it securely on jack stands or a lift.&nbsp; Make sure the car is safe and
secure before getting under at all!&nbsp; See the TOS Agreement for the full
legal disclaimer.&nbsp; The <a href="../a5/jack-stand-lift-point-mk5.htm">jack
points on my 2006 Jetta are shown here</a>.&nbsp; They may be different on your
car so refer to your service manual.&nbsp; The car must be level for this
procedure or else the fluid level will be off.&nbsp; The wood cribbing blocks
seen in the video are custom made, here are my notes regarding them: <a href="wood-block.htm">1000q:
wood support blocks</a>. </p>

<p>Remove the splash shield.&nbsp; On the earlier mk5 cars there are 8x T25 screws along
the sides and 3x T30 screws on the rear.&nbsp; On the later mk5, mk6 and Audi A3,
there may be an additional T25 at the center-front.&nbsp; It likes to come off
and be installed at a certain angle because of some nubs on the front.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/splashshieldJetta.jpg" alt="jetta splash pan" width="900" height="449"> </p>

<p>Open the hood and remove the engine cover.&nbsp; Just pull up at the corners
and you can feel where the rubber ball-socket snaps are.&nbsp; You can even
grease the ball-sockets for a little easier removal: <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f7/dweisels-cr-ez-engine-cover-removal-5396/">dweisel's
cover grease tip</a>&nbsp; <b>CAUTION</b>:
The fluid, exhaust, and engine will be hot, especially if the car was just driven.&nbsp;
Take all precautions to avoid being scalded. </p>

<p>Remove the air filter box.&nbsp; See <a href="../a5/air-filter-box-replacement-jetta.htm">1000q:
air filter box</a> for more details.&nbsp; Remove the battery and battery
shelf.&nbsp; Some models have enough clearance to get to the filter.&nbsp; Note:
you will have to reset the one touch windows, memory seats, and steering
adaptation after you disconnect the battery.&nbsp; See <a href="../a5/battery-replacement-Jetta-Golf-TDI.htm">1000q:
battery shelf</a> for more details. </p>

<p>Wipe down the area around the filter cap because dirt likes to settle there.&nbsp;
Then use a 24mm socket to remove the filter cap.&nbsp; Tilt the filter and let
it drip a little into the housing.&nbsp; Remove the filter and remove the cap's
o-ring.&nbsp; Suck out the fluid sitting in the filter hosing using an oil
evacuator or hand vacuum pump.&nbsp; Lube the new o-ring and filter base.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-filter.jpg" alt="dsg filter" width="667" height="500"> </p>

<p>Underneath the car, use a 14mm allen bit to open the DSG fluid drain.&nbsp;
This is a large size so don't expect to find it that day at your local parts
store.&nbsp; Then use an 8mm allen bit to remove the plastic snorkel insert
underneath the drain plug.&nbsp; Make sure
you have a pan to catch the fluid.&nbsp; Measure how much fluid is
drained.&nbsp; If you drain exactly 4.5L, you can do measure-refill.&nbsp; If
you don't, something could be wrong.&nbsp; The transmission could be leaking fluid or
it's not perfectly level.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-drain-plug.jpg" alt="dsg drain plug location" width="806" height="500"> </p>

<h3><a href="../../images/misc/dsg/walmartfunnel.jpg"></a>Measure-refill VW DSG fluid change procedure </h3>

<p>Install the plastic snorkel insert and tighten to 2.25 ft-lbs (3 NM).&nbsp;
Install the drain plug to 33 ft-lbs (45 NM).&nbsp; Your kit may come with a new
drain washer but if it doesn't, the washer doesn't appear to be a crush washer and the old one
shouldn't leak. </p>

<p>Shake each bottle of DSG fluid to mix the additives. </p>

<p>Add 4.5 L of fluid to the transmission.&nbsp; You can add 4.6 L to account for any drips and what was in the filter. </p>

<p>A top fill is recommended with measure-refill.&nbsp; Use a funnel to avoid wasting that expensive fluid and just
pour it into the filter housing.&nbsp; Plus 3 Golfer reported that a hoppy-flo
1.0L funnel from walmart (shown below, click to enlarge) works fine and the tip fits the filter
housing hole perfectly.&nbsp; A pic by turbo-d shows it in use. It also has a valve to control how fast the fluid
leaves the reservoir.<br>
<a href="../../images/misc/dsg/walmartfunnel.jpg" rel="lightbox-f"><img src="../../images/misc/dsg/tn/walmartfunnel-tn.jpg" alt="" width="104" height="200" border="0"></a><a href="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-funnel.jpg" rel="lightbox-f"><img src="../../images/misc/dsg/tn/dsg-funnel-tn.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Because the housing hole is small, it will take at least 40 minutes to add
  4.5L but you don't have to do the factory method's overflow check which saves
  time.&nbsp; The warmer the fluid, the
easier it will flow. </p>

<p>If you do a bottom fill, some fluid will be in the fill hose and it makes it
harder to calculate exactly how much fluid was put in.&nbsp; You could just pour
the fluid in the hose into an opened bottle when you're done if you wish to
calculate how much was added. </p>

<p>Reinstall the filter and tighten the cap to 15 ft-lbs (20 NM).&nbsp; You do
not overfill the transmission and drain off any excess with this method.&nbsp;
You do not measure the fluid temperature.&nbsp; Reinstall the battery, air
filter box, splash pan, and engine cover. </p>

<p>If you just want to fill through the top and then do a factory method
overflow check, make sure to add at least 0.5L more than you drained.&nbsp; In
that case, you do have to overfill the transmission and measure fluid temp. </p>

<p>It's normal for the steering
wheel light to be on, see the FAQ articles mentioned earlier if they don't go
away after normal driving.&nbsp; Go for a test drive and check for leaks. </p>

<h3>Factory method for VW DSG fluid drain and refill </h3>

<p>The factory method is to overfill the transmission and let any excess
overflow out the top of the snorkel and out the drain.&nbsp; The transmission fluid
must be at the right temperature or else the fluid level won't be right. </p>

<p>Install the plastic snorkel insert and tighten to 2.25 ft-lbs (3 NM).&nbsp;
<strong>CAUTION</strong>: A few people have broken the plastic snorkel! 3 NM is only finger tight, not wrench tight! If you break it, the replacement is VW# 02e 321 363 b (same PN for transverse gas or diesel DSG)</p>
<p>If you choose to do a top fill, lightly install the drain plug.&nbsp; If you choose to do a bottom fill, install your VAS6262 or equivalent. </p>

<p> Shake each
bottle of DSG fluid to mix the additives. </p>

<p>Poke a hole in the bottom of each bottle so
that air can come in and let the fluid drain.&nbsp; If your hoses are clamped
securely, you can put a compressed air nozzle to the hole to help the fluid
move.&nbsp; Regulate the air pressure down to a very low setting because you don't want the clamps or hoses to pop off and
spill that expensive fluid everywhere!&nbsp; If you're just using gravity, the
higher the bottle, the more the transmission will be filled.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-fill-tool.jpg" alt="dsg vas 6262" width="667" height="462"> </p>

<p>The factory service manual says to use 5.5 L but again, if you only drained
4.5L out, I would only open 5 bottles.&nbsp; There's no need to open a 6th
bottle just to drain it out later. </p>

<p>Reinstall the filter and tighten the cap to 15 ft-lbs (20 NM).&nbsp;
Reinstall the battery and air filter box.&nbsp; It's normal for the steering
wheel light to be on, see the FAQ articles mentioned earlier if they don't go
away after normal driving. </p>

<p>Make sure the fill tool and hose are clear of any engine fans or belts.&nbsp;
Turn the ignition ON but DO NOT START. </p>

<p>Plug in your ross tech VCDS cable and look for the green LED on the
cable.&nbsp; Start the software and select the control modules.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vcds-main-screen.png"> </p>

<p>Select Automatic transmission and then Select Measuring Blocks -08.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/auto.png" alt="dsg fluid temperature" width="639" height="454"> </p>

<p>Select Group 19.&nbsp; The first block is transmission fluid temperature.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-fluid-temperature.png" alt="atf temperature" width="639" height="454"> </p>

<p>You can now start the engine.&nbsp; Make sure the brakes are applied this
whole time just in case the car moves.&nbsp; Have a helper, with parking brake on and foot always firmly applying the
brakes, start the engine and shift through each position, pausing for at least 3 seconds
at each position.&nbsp; You can repeat as desired.&nbsp; Return to park and
leave the engine idling.&nbsp; This fills up the filter and any
air pockets. </p>

<p>Once the DSG fluid reaches 35<sup>o</sup>C
(95F), remove VAS6262 and get the drain plug ready.&nbsp; If you did a top fill,
remove the drain plug.&nbsp; Excess fluid will overflow over the top of the snorkel and out the drain
hole.&nbsp; The fluid
should not be over 45<sup>o</sup>C and absolutely not over 50<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;
There's an extra squirt every 30 seconds due to a fluid pump.&nbsp;
Ignore this when determining the fluid level.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-oil-pan.png" alt="dsg fluid check" width="830" height="300"><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/dsg/dsg-level.png"></p>

<p> The service manual says to reinstall the drain plug 33 ft-lbs (45 NM)when the fluid slows to a
drip. Because of the underfill trend mentioned in the introduction I plug the drain when it slows to a dribble and on the cooler side.&nbsp; If you drained 4.5 L,
added 5.0 L and notice any more than 0.5 L draining out, something may be wrong.&nbsp;
Your kit may come with a new drain washer but if it doesn't, the washer isn't a
crush washer and the old one shouldn't leak. </p>

<p>Once the drain plug is in place, you can shut the engine off.&nbsp; The rest of installation is the
reverse of removal.&nbsp; Go for a test drive and check for leaks. </p>
