<h1>DIY ignition switch and lock cylinder removal and repair on VW and Audi</h1><a href="../../1000q.htm">
back to 1000q: general&nbsp; &quot;how to&quot; index</a>
<p><font size="4"><b>Introduction
</b></font><h2>This article shows how to repair and replace the lock cylinder
and ignition switch on a VW (2006 Jetta shown, other years and Audi similar)</h2>
<p>Mk4 generation VW use a slightly different ignition switch.&nbsp; Mk5-mk6 are
about the same and all VW are close enough to that they're all included in this
article.</p>
<p>First you have to remove the trim below the steering wheel and the lower
steering column trim.</p>
<p>For mk4 VW Jetta, Golf and Passat, see <a href="../b5/trimSteeringWheel.htm">1000q: trim removal</a>
(Passat shown but other models similar).&nbsp; Steering wheel removal is not
required.</p>
<p>For mk5 (and probably newer) you have to remove the steering wheel.&nbsp; See
<a href="../a5/paddle-shifter-steering-wheel-swap.htm">1000q:
mk5 steering wheel removal</a>.&nbsp; The full article is for
forum members only but enough is shown that you can get the steering wheel off
if you don't feel like signing up.&nbsp; Then you have
access to remove the lower steering column trim (2 torx bolts below).<br>

<p>If you're replacing the ignition switch, make sure that nothing is melted or
that the wire harness is intact because the ignition lock cylinder and switch are fairly reliable.</p>

torque wrench<br>

<h3>Procedure for ignition switch and lock cylinder removal</h3>
<p>First watch this video, it explains some of the things mentioned in the
procedure.&nbsp; A mk5 is shown but it's pretty much the same for earlier and
later cars. The entire assembly is removed from the car for illustration.<br><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/5Bl3mdzLaYc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>If you have a mk4, remove the purple plug at the end of the lock cylinder
assembly.&nbsp; Then remove the 2 screws covered by red paint.&nbsp; You can now
slide the ignition switch out.&nbsp; If you need to remove the lock cylinder, remove
the turn signal and wiper stalk.&nbsp; See <a href="../b5/clicking-turn-signal-relay-repair-vw.htm">1000q:
turn signal removal</a> for details.&nbsp; As you can see, there's a lot of dust
in there so it tends to get dirt on the contacts and click.&nbsp; Now would be a
good time to clean it as much as practical.<br>

<p>If you have a mk5, the ignition switch is at the end of the assembly shown
below.&nbsp; To remove the lock cylinder you may have to remove the clockspring
and turn signals.&nbsp; It should be obvious how to remove them now that the
trim is off.&nbsp; There are a few tiny torx screws and plastic hooks. If you can't figure it out, feel free to sign up to the <a href="../../forum/index.php">VW
TDI forum and Audi TDI forums</a>.<br>

<p>Here is more detail on the assembly.&nbsp; To remove the steering column lock assembly you have to drill out
the 2 snap bolts holding it to the steering column.&nbsp; In my case I just cut
it off since this was a spare steering column.<br>

<p>To remove the lock cylinder-immobilizer antenna for all mk4 and newer, turn
the key to ON and insert a paper clip through the hole shown.&nbsp; See the
video above for a demonstration.&nbsp; Don't worry, this info can't be used to
help steal your car.&nbsp; The key must be turned to ON for the paper clip to be
able to release the unlock.&nbsp; If you use a screwdriver to try to turn the
cylinder it will just spin the assembly.<br>
