<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The door lock assembly module uses an electronic solenoid to unlock the
door.&nbsp; The most common problem is failure of the microswitch or circuit
board inside.&nbsp; This results in failure of the door to know when the door
has been opened or closed.&nbsp; The door either thinks it's open or closed all
the time since the switch no longer senses it.&nbsp; This can cause problems
with the door locking by themselves or the alarm going off. </p>

<p>A broken wire at the door hinge (under the rubber accordian-like boot) can
cause door problems as well. </p>

<p>To isolate a problem, here is a test for the most common failure - the
driver's side door microswitch.&nbsp; Set the overhead light to turn on when the
door is opened.&nbsp; Open the passenger side door - the light should turn
on.&nbsp; Shut the door - the light should go off after a while.&nbsp; The
driver's side door should do the same thing.&nbsp; Also compare to the rear
doors. </p>

<p>Another test you can do is, with the doors locked, unlock the doors using the
remote.&nbsp; Do not open the door.&nbsp; The doors should relock themselves in
30 seconds.&nbsp; This is a feature to prevent accidental unlocking.&nbsp; Now
do the same test but open the door.&nbsp; If the door module switches are
working correctly, the doors should not relock themselves. </p>

<h3>Door module removal procedure </h3>

<p>Lower the window all the way and remove the door card.&nbsp; For Jetta/golf,
see <a href="../a4/door-card-removal.htm">1000q: mk4 Jetta door card removal</a>.&nbsp;
For the B5.5 VW Passat see <a href="../b5/doorcardB5remove.htm">1000q: mk4 VW
Passat door card panel removal</a>.</p>
<p>Punch out the center of the 2x plastic plugs indicated by the yellow arrows
below.&nbsp; I don't know if you have to punch them out all the way but once the
inner metal door skin is loose you can retrieve them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also push in
the rubber seal where the inside door latch cable passes through the inner metal
door skin and the door plunger (yellow arrows). <br>

<p>Below is a picture without the door skin for illustration.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm2.jpg" width="810" height="664"></p>
<p>Remove the 10mm bolts holding the inner metal door skin to the door.&nbsp; You can't remove it since the window regulator is still attached to
the window, you only need to pull it away from the door enough to unplug the wire
plug on the lock module.&nbsp; Remove the plug on the lock module,
indicated with yellow arrow below.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm3.jpg" width="720" height="316"></p>
<p>Remove the plastic plug covering the T-20 torx screw indicated below and unscrew
the T-20 torx screw as far as possible.&nbsp; You can remove the 2x 8mm triple square
bolts holding the door module to the door frame now or later.&nbsp; They are not
torx bolts, don't use a torx bit on them!&nbsp; The
third one without an arrow doesn't need to be removed unless you want to remove
the handle.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm4.jpg" width="518" height="720"></p>
<p>You can now pry out the driver's side lock cylinder or pass side cover.&nbsp;
This unlocks the handle cable.&nbsp; Once the lock cylinder or cover is off, open the door handle and pry
out the cable. <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm5.jpg" width="720" height="540"></p>
<p>Here is another picture with the handle cable halfway off for illustration,
outlined in yellow below.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm6.jpg" width="845" height="531"></p>
<p>The door module can now be removed.&nbsp; During installation, add medium
strength threadlocker on the triple square bolts.&nbsp; Push the plastic rivets
holding the door module in from behind.&nbsp; Also make sure the
weatherstripping around the inner metal door skin is seated properly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f5/04-vw-passat-tdi-front-passenger-door-lock-14858/">Here is someone who managed to get the door open after the handle wouldn't open the door.</a></p>

<h3>Door handle removal</h3>

<p>If you want to remove the door handle, remove the third triple square
bolt.&nbsp; The handle should pull back and out.&nbsp; During installation, add
medium strength threadlocker on the triple square bolt.&nbsp; Note the little
flexible flap on the forward side of the handle - it should be inside the door
during installation.</p>
