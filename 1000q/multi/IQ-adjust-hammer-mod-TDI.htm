<h2>This article shows how to test or change the fuel injection quantity on a VW
TDI or Audi TDI engine.</h2>
<p>Fuel injection quantity (IQ), the amount of fuel injected into the engine
with each stroke, is adjustable in your TDI.&nbsp; This article focuses on
1996-2003 VW TDI sold in North America or any TDI that use the electronic Bosch
VW injection pump.&nbsp; You can use the below procedure on 2004 TDI and newer to check the IQ but you cannot change it.&nbsp; To change IQ on 2004 TDI and
newer, you need chip tuning.&nbsp; An IQ adjustment is also not a substitute for
chip tuning for the earlier cars.</p>
<p>Injection quantity depends on fuel temperature, rpm, load, smoke, injection duration, coolant
temperature, and measured air flow.&nbsp; Incorrect IQ can cause slow down
engine shudder, rough idling, smoky running, poor starting, poor economy,
basically anything to do with fuel.&nbsp; It's recommended to check IQ anytime after adjusting
fuel nozzles, power chip, or if you just want to adjust the car's level of
smoke.&nbsp; Also check the IQ if you just purchased the car
because it is sometimes set incorrectly from the factory or previous owner.&nbsp; If you have low
power, see the below section as well.&nbsp; Adjusting IQ can also smooth out engine shudder when engine rpms drop.</p>
<p> Increasing fueling will increase smoke and power and
lower fuel economy.&nbsp; Decreasing fueling will decrease smoke and power and
raise fuel economy.&nbsp; If you just changed your nozzles to
restore the fuel injectors, they are delivering a different amount of fuel, even if you replaced them with the same sized nozzles.&nbsp; For
example, when you put &quot;.184&quot; sized nozzles on the original fuel
injectors, your original nozzles may actually be .170mm instead of your new
.184mm nozzles.</p>
<p>The slight adjustment in fuel economy is not just because of less smoke/wasted fuel but
also slightly changes how the car responds to the accelerator pedal.&nbsp; Driving from
point a to b requires a minimum amount of energy/fuel.&nbsp; Faster than optimum
(for fuel economy) acceleration means you use more energy/fuel than the
minimum.&nbsp; Decreasing fueling through a change in IQ produces a similar result as decreasing how far and fast you press down on the accelerator
pedal.&nbsp; Since most drivers use more acceleration than needed for
maximum fuel economy, decreasing IQ <i> could be</i> like giving the
driver greater foot control for maximum fuel economy.&nbsp;
This is not a recommendation to put the IQ out of its normal range on a stock,
unmodified car!&nbsp; The accelerator pedal in all TDI is drive by
wire, meaning there's no cable connected to a mechanical throttle.&nbsp; At the
base of the pedal is an electronic potentiometer which sends a signal to the
car's computer.&nbsp; Changing IQ does not affect the accelerator pedal signal.</p>
<p>How much could fuel economy or power increase?&nbsp; The difference is small and there are too many variations between drivers,
driving styles, and cars to say it will even result in a noticeable change.&nbsp; Since this test will not hurt your car in
any way, try adjusting IQ within the normal range, drive the car for a while, then see how you like it.</p>
<p>There are two ways to adjust IQ - through software adaptation using a VCDS
ross tech cable or mechanically.&nbsp; Sometimes the injection pump is set
incorrectly from the factory and requires a mechanical adjustment.&nbsp; If you reach the limit of how far you can
adjust IQ through software adaptation then you have to adjust IQ
mechanically.&nbsp; Inside the fuel pump's quantity adjuster
(QA), there is an electronically operated arm that moves back and forth to
adjust the IQ.&nbsp; If the software is telling the arm to move all the way to
one side but it's at its limits, adjust the physical range of movement.</p>
<p><b>Rules for adjusting IQ and the QA's reaction<br>
</b>The normal range for IQ value on a stock, unmodified car is 3-5 mg/str at
idle and 36-38 at full throttle.&nbsp; Too low and the car is overfueling, too
high and the car is underfueling.<br>
If you want less fuel you want a higher IQ value, lower software adaptation
number, QA moves left towards fuel filter (passenger side for left hand drive
cars).<br>
If you want more fuel you want a lower IQ value, higher software adaptation
number, QA moves right towards battery (driver's side for left hand drive cars).</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<h4>Testing and changing IQ with software adaptation</h4>
<p>Drive the car and let it warm up to normal operating temperature.&nbsp; While
idling, plug in the VCDS cable and start the software.</p>
<p>Click on &quot;Engine&quot; and you'll see the screen below (the controller
info numbers may be different).&nbsp; Click on &quot;login&quot; in the screen
below.&nbsp; Login using the code
&quot;12233&quot; and hit enter.&nbsp; Go back to the last screen and Click on &quot;adaptation&quot;.&nbsp;
Select block 1.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/IQadjust1.jpg" width="630" height="449"></p>
<p>Block 1 should show the IQ.&nbsp; The IQ value is normally about &quot;3.0-5.0
mg/str&quot;.&nbsp;
If the IQ is bouncing around as much as 1 to 6 then the engine isn't warmed up
or there's either an injection pump internal fault or ECU fault.&nbsp; The default adaptation
number, whether you have a chip or not, is 32768.&nbsp; A lower adaptation
number entered in the blank will reduce fueling and increase
the &quot;x.x&quot; m/R value.&nbsp; A higher adaptation number entered will
increase fueling and lower the &quot;x.x&quot; mg/R value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hit &quot;test&quot; after entering your adaptation number and the IQ, the &quot;x.x&quot;
mg/str value
will change.&nbsp; There is a mechanical limit to how high or low
you can change the adaptation number since it's just software.&nbsp; If you
reach the limit the software won't let you click on &quot;save&quot;.&nbsp;
Click up or down to change the adaptation number until you see where the limit
is.&nbsp; If you can't get to the desired IQ then you need to do the hammer mod
to mechanically change the QA's range of movement, see below for details.</p>
<p>Again:<br>
If you want less fuel you want a higher IQ value, lower software adaptation
number, QA moves left towards fuel filter (passenger side for north american
cars).<br>
If you want more fuel you want a lower IQ value, higher software adaptation
number, QA moves right towards battery (driver's side for north american
cars).</p>
<p>Hit &quot;save&quot; when you are satisfied.&nbsp; When you're done, go back
and make sure the values you wanted are still there because if you
forget to hit save there's no change.&nbsp; Go for a test drive.&nbsp; After
adjusting the IQ you should notice a difference in throttle response, power, and
smoke.&nbsp; As long as the car has enough drivable power, I prefer a setting on
the high side because this will help reduce smoke (unburned fuel).&nbsp; I would
not adjust IQ much higher than about 5.5 at idle since power starts to
noticeably drop off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<hr>
<h4>Testing the IQ and checking for correct IQ range</h4>
<p>If you're having low power issues the problem could be a bad QA or a QA out
of adjustment.&nbsp; Sometimes the QA is bolted on incorrectly at the factory or
a previous owner replaced the seal underneath the QA and didn't adjust it
correctly.</p>
<p>Drive the car and let it warm up to normal operating temperature.&nbsp; While
idling, plug in the VCDS cable.&nbsp; Click on &quot; engine&quot; - you should
see the screen in the above picture.&nbsp; Click on &quot;Meas.
Blocks&quot;.&nbsp; Go to Group 15 or click on &quot;up&quot; 15 times.&nbsp;
You should see the below screen.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/IQadjust2.png" width="634" height="454"></p>
<p>Inj Qty (actual) at idle is normally 3-5 mg/str.&nbsp; Full throttle
(pictured above) is about
34-36 mg/str.&nbsp; At idle, Inj Qty requested (accelerator) can be 0 because
you're not touching the accelerator pedal.&nbsp; If the IQ is bouncing around as
much as 1 to 6 then the engine isn't warmed up or there's either an injection
pump internal fault or ECU fault.</p>
<p>Go for a test drive, making sure your helper operates the computer - you
don't want to get distracted and crash the car!&nbsp; The Inj Qty actual and
requested should stay close together as you drive.&nbsp; If they aren't, you are
having a fueling problem that the computer is aware of.&nbsp; It's not the
accelerator pedal since that should trip an error code.&nbsp; It could be an
internal injection pump failure, bad ECU, bad QA, sticking fuel shut off
solenoid, or <a href="TDI-nozzle-FAQ.htm">bad fuel injectors/nozzles</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Hammer mod to mechanically change QA's range of movement</h4>
<p>If you have reached the limit of software adjustment to change the IQ, you
need to change the QA's mechanical range of movement.&nbsp; This lets the
electronic arm inside the pump move farther.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset the IQ through
VCDS to the default factory value.&nbsp; This way you change only one thing at a
time.&nbsp; Note the IQ value.&nbsp; Again:<br>
If you want less fuel you want a higher IQ value, lower software adaptation
number, QA moves left towards fuel filter (passenger side for north american
cars).<br>
If you want more fuel you want a lower IQ value, higher software adaptation
number, QA moves right towards battery (driver's side for north american
cars).</p>
<p>Drive the car and let it warm up to normal operating temperature.&nbsp; Shut
off the engine.&nbsp; Remove the engine cover (3x 10mm nuts). </p>
<p>Loosen the 3x T-30 torx bolts and the 1 triangle Bosch security bolt circled
below.&nbsp; Use Bosch PN#
&quot;0-986-612-605&quot; or the equivalent tools to loosen the security
bolt.&nbsp; Only loosen them hand tight, enough to slide the QA left
or right without having a fuel leak.&nbsp; You do not remove the QA - only
loosen it so that it can slide left or right to adjust the arm inside. <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/IQadjust3.jpg" width="1016" height="663"></p>
<p>First, use a pad like a block of wood or use a rubber or deadblow mallet to
prevent damage to the metal.&nbsp; Tap on the middle section of the
injection pump, the QA, left or right to slide it and change the IQ.&nbsp; It's safe to
gently tap on the
areas highlighted in green above.&nbsp; This can be done with the engine running
to see the change in real time.&nbsp; Once it's around 4 (3-5 is acceptable), recheck that the
bolts are tight and
recheck the IQ.&nbsp; You can now fine tune it using the VCDS software using the
above steps.</p>
<p>Below is a video showing how hard to tap the pump.&nbsp; If it's not moving,
loosen the bolts a tiny bit more.&nbsp; If you have any more questions, feel free to ask in the
forums linked at the top or search the site:<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/a9kfXQyO_NQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
