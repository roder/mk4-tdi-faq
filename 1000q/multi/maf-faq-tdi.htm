<h1> TDI engine TDI MAF/MAS (Mass air flow sensor) FAQ, for volkswagen TDI
(diesel) 1996+</h1>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article discusses the two types of MAF used on VW TDI and Audi TDI
engines and what the
car's computer does with the information from the MAF.</h2>
<p> The mk3 uses a hot
wire, the mk4, mk5, and mk6 VW and Audi&nbsp; use a thin film or hot film MAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Why does the car need a MAF?</h3>
<p>Modern electronically fuel metered cars like the VW TDI all use a MAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Using a MAF sensor is one way of directly measuring how much air is
passing the MAF sensor and into the engine.&nbsp; Other cars may
calculate air flow instead of measuring it  by using other air flow sensors and taking into
account engine rpm, throttle position, and air temperature.&nbsp; Knowing how
much air the engine is getting is important because the car's computer uses this
value to know how much fuel to give the engine.&nbsp; This is one reason
why it's important to have an airtight intake tract after the MAF sensor.&nbsp;
The amount of metered air won't be correct if it's leaking out a disconnected hose!&nbsp;
Air leaks are called vacuum or boost leaks, see <a href="boost-leak-tester-DIY-check.htm">1000q:
boost leak test</a> for more reasons why this is bad and how to check for it in
your turbo car.</p>
<p>A faulty MAF signal will cause the car's computer to give too much or too
little fuel.&nbsp; However, a TDI can run without a MAF signal at all, as can
many cars.&nbsp; The car computer knows that there is either a nonsense signal
or none at all and uses a default value to keep the engine
running.&nbsp; The computer takes the engine load and speed, modifies the value
for some fuel and engine temperature readings and MAF value, etc., to determine
fuel injection timing and metering.&nbsp; A gasoline car will run poorly with no
MAF because they have to be within a narrower air/fuel ratio to run smoothly
compared to a diesel engine.&nbsp; Your TDI can run without the MAF but
performance will be poor and the engine should feel sluggish and you should feel
a lack of power.&nbsp; See <a href="../a4/MAF-sensor-testing-VW-cleaner.htm">1000q: mk4 MAF testing</a> for more tips on testing
your mk4 MAF.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MAF also changed from a hot wire to a hot film type after the mk3 generation, see below for more details.</p>
<p>Never use silicone detailing sprays or silicone products that have not cured near the intake on a running engine. These could deposit on the MAF and contaminate the sensor.</p>
<h3>Mk3 TDI</h3>
<p>The mk3 TDI uses a Pierberg MAF.&nbsp; This is a hot wire type MAF.&nbsp;
Unlike the mk4 cars, it's a simpler device and it's unusual for the MAF to fail.&nbsp; VW part number is # 074-906-461

<p>The hot wire MAF is composed of a thermistor (temperature sensing) wire and
an ammeter (measures electrical amps). Since the MAF wire is a &quot;positive
k&quot; thermistor, the hotter it gets, the higher its resistance. The colder it
gets, the lower its resistance, and the more current that passes through the
wire. However, the more current flowing through the wire, the hotter it gets
(similar to an electric heater). This sets an upper stable limit of current,
since as the resistance of the wire increases, the less current that flows
through it. This &quot;stable&quot; point changes depending on how much air is
flowing past the wire, providing cooling. The more air flowing past the wire,
the more current the wire can allow through before it heats up enough to offset
the current. Therefore, at any given time, the amount of air flowing through the
MAF is proportional to the amount of current flowing through the wire in the
sensor.</p>
<p>The output voltage increases directly with the measured airflow.</p>
<p>To clean it, use a non-residue electrical cleaner.&nbsp; These are slightly
different than brake or carb cleaner.&nbsp; It's also possible that there is a
wiring harness short or corroded plug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mk4, mk5, and mk6 TDI</h3>
<p>The mk4 and mk5 TDI use a Bosch hot film MAF.&nbsp; This is a membrane type MAF
and can take much faster and more accurate measurements than a hot wire.&nbsp;
It is known for a slow loss of function and causing low power in the TDI and was
an extended recall item on pre 2002 mk4 TDIs..&nbsp; The most recent OEM part
numbers are #  038 906 461 C for the ALH engine,
#038-906-461-B for the BEW and
mk5 BRM pumpe duse engines (same part), #074 906 461 b
for the 04-05 Passat BHW engine, but check with your VW part dealer to see if this is current.&nbsp;
VW has gone through a number of MAF part numbers, the latest part number for the
ALH engine ends in
&quot;c&quot;.&nbsp; The housing is very different but it's not known if it's
more robust than earlier designs because the element is what fails.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/maf3.jpg" width="540" height="759"></p>
<p>MAFs from VW gasser models will bolt on, but I would not use them because they
require modification to send the right signal and a new or rebuilt MAF should
only cost around $120.</p>
<p>Here is the location of the MAF outlined in yellow.&nbsp; The
&quot;chip&quot; element is replaceable separately from the &quot;chip+plastic
housing&quot;, see <a href="../a4/MAF-sensor-testing-VW-cleaner.htm">1000q: mk4 MAF testing</a> for more
troubleshooting tips.<br>

<p>A hot film MAF is comprised of a diaphragm with a heating zone and two
symmetrically arranged temperature sensors on either side of the heating zone. A
control circuit maintains the heating zone at a constant temperature above
ambient such that the downstream sensor reads a lower (but constant) temperature,
regardless of ambient air temperature. The more air that blows past the upstream
sensor, the cooler it is when compared to the downstream sensor. Thus, the
change in temperature (&#916;T) between the upstream and downstream temperature
sensor is proportional to the amount (and direction) of air mass flowing over
the membrane. A thin film MAF can also detect a reverse flow of air.</p>
<p>The graph below of a thin film MAF shows how the temperature is steady before
and after the heating zone with no air flow but changes with air flow.</p>
