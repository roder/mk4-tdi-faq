<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>The starting system on a VW TDI or Audi TDI fairly simple.&nbsp; There are only a few things that could result in a no start.&nbsp; This article describes
starter troubleshooting and then starter removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> Although there are small
differences over the years/models, the basic troubleshooting is pretty similar.&nbsp;
The starter assembly consists of the starter motor and a solenoid.&nbsp; When
you turn the ignition key to start, the solenoid pushes out the starter gear to
engage the starter ring on the flywheel (driveplate if automatic transmission) and gives the motor 12V which
turns the engine over.&nbsp; If you hear a metal
on metal grinding noise after you release the key from the start position, the starter is sticking
out and grinding against the
flywheel starter ring when it should be retracted.&nbsp; The sticking is caused
by excessive dirt build up on the starter shaft or a bad bearing inside
the starter.</p>
<p>Always disconnect both positive and negative battery terminals and make sure
that there are no flammable fumes or sources of ignition nearby!&nbsp; Batteries
give off explosive hydrogen gas and can pop and splash acid everywhere.&nbsp; Always wear eye protection and follow
all precautions listed in the factory service manual.&nbsp; Take care to not touch the
battery terminals together when at least one side is connected to the battery or let any metal object such as a wrench or necklace touch them
together and ground!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Starter repair procedure</h3>
<h4>Starter troubleshooting</h4>
<p>If the starter does not engage a second time after releasing the ignition key
from &quot;start&quot;, this is normal.&nbsp; You have to turn the key all the
way to &quot;off&quot; before it will go to &quot;start&quot; again.&nbsp;
That's how VWs are.</p>
<p>If you have an automatic transmission, the car will prevent starting if the
gear selector is not in Park or Neutral.</p>
<p>If you don't see the glow plug light on when turn the key to start, it could
be a bad relay 109.&nbsp; 2004 and newer <a href="../pumpedusedesc.htm"> pumpe duse</a>
cars do not have this problem, only 1996-2003 TDI have it.&nbsp; Relay 109 controls power to the ECU.&nbsp; Look at the
relay panel under the dash, you may have to remove 2 or 3 screws to see the
relay panel.&nbsp; If the relay marked 109 is black then it could have
failed.&nbsp; The updated part is gray.&nbsp; The normal failure is the car dies
during normal driving and then restarts once the relay has cooled.&nbsp; Because
initial failures are related to overheating, you are more likely to see this
problem during driving than cold starts.</p>
<p>First determine if the problem is related to a low battery.&nbsp; You should
normally still hear the solenoid click at the starter and detect other symptoms
of a low battery.&nbsp; Test for at least 12V at the battery with a multimeter when the engine
is off, about 14V when the engine is running.&nbsp; If the engine is cranking
but not starting, it is not a starter problem, it is probably an air or fuel problem, or
a sensor problem causing the no-start.&nbsp; If the battery voltage plummets
when starting you could have a bad battery. For example, if it drops to 4v when cranking and the battery were good, a fuse would pop or the battery cables would be really hot.</p>
<p>It could also be a faulty ignition switch.&nbsp; Some Jetta and Passat TDI
(mk3) had a recall on
this.&nbsp; If you have occasional problems starting but can start the car by
wiggling the key in the ignition switch, in/out, left/right,&nbsp; the problem is probably in the ignition
switch (this will only work a few times until the switch completely
fails).&nbsp; You can test this by turning and holding the key to start.&nbsp;
You should see at least 8V at the starter plug (terminal 50, pictured above).&nbsp;
The problem is made worse by hanging weight off the ignition switch like other
keys, etc.</p>
<p>A bad or loose connection to the starter can also cause starting
problems.&nbsp; Make sure that the electrical connections to the starter are
clean and corrosion free.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a braided heavy gauge wire going
from the solenoid to the starter, this can become damaged and cause a poor
connection.</p>
<p>VW models after about 2000 have an immobilizer but it will still let you start the
engine without a problem but will shut engine off after 1 second if there is an
immobilizer problem.&nbsp; Another clue is a blinking immobilizer warning light on the
dashboard.&nbsp; Click here to see <a href="immobilizer-VW-Audi-FAQ.htm">1000q:
immobilizer general troubleshooting FAQ</a>.&nbsp; So if the engine does start
fine but quickly shuts
down, there is nothing wrong with the starter.&nbsp; There could be something
wrong with the ignition key since there is an immobilizer ring antenna on it, see the
immobilizer FAQ for more details.</p>
<p>The alarm system can also be faulty and prevent the ignition signal from reaching the
starter solenoid at terminal 50.&nbsp; The alarm is part of the central
convenience module (CCM) which also controls power windows, remote keyless
entry.</p>
<p>If you have a manual transmission, the clutch safety switch or wiring could
be faulty, it can also prevent starting (The 1996-1997 passat oddly has a
clutch safety switch installed under the clutch pedal but it is not connected to
any sort of clutch pedal starter interlock, it is only connected to the cruise control
system).&nbsp; There is also a relay on the fuse-relay panel
under the dashboard. Mk3 have no starter interlock relay since there were no mk3 automatic transmission TDI sold in North america. Mk4 have a starter relay in position 3.</p>
<p>Only do this next test if you are comfortable working on the car's electrical
systems!&nbsp; You can put 12V directly to the starter wiring to bypass the solenoid
and terminal to
test the starter while it's still on the car.&nbsp; Remove the positive and
negative plugs on the starter and apply 12V to the wiring.&nbsp; If the starter
spins, then the problem is in the wiring, controls, or the solenoid.&nbsp; If the starter
does not spin, then the problem is in the starter or its wire connections.&nbsp;
The engine will turn over if it's working so be careful!</p>
<p>Once you remove the starter from the car, you can also do the same test to determine if
you only need to replace the solenoid.</p>
<p>Here is a video that helps explain most of these points:</p>

<h4>Removal</h4>
<p>Make sure that there are no sources of ignition including flammable vapors or
liquids nearby!&nbsp; When you remove the battery terminals there may be a spark
and it could ignite any exposed fuels.&nbsp; Although diesel fuel is not easily
ignited at room temperature and pressure, always evacuate all fuel and vapors
when working with the electrical system.&nbsp; Always remove the negative terminal
first and put it back last!&nbsp; If you are working near or with the battery or
cables remove all loose or uncovered watches, rings, necklaces and follow all
cautions in the factory service manual, see the TOS Agreement for the full legal
disclaimer.</p>
<p>Raise the car safely as specified in the factory service manual and remove the
splash shield or <a href="../a4/Skid-plate-install.htm">skid
plate</a> under the engine.&nbsp; You may not be able to reach the lower starter bolt
from the top.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disconnect both the positive and negative battery terminals and safely set
them aside (2x 10mm nuts).&nbsp; I suggest wrapping
them with gloves or electrical tape so that they cannot touch the battery
terminals.&nbsp; This would be a good time to clean the terminals wires and battery terminals with
the battery cleaner brush.</p>
<p>(Optional) remove the battery - it may be held down with a 13mm bolt and
bracket.&nbsp; In some models, you may have to remove the intake air hoses and
air intake to get better access.</p>
<p>If you did not remove the battery terminals, go back and remove them
now!&nbsp; Gently remove all the plugs and cables out of the cable bracket or
starter.&nbsp; Also remove the starter positive wire (1x 13mm nut).</p>
<p>Use an extension with the 13mm deep socket to remove the cable bracket that
is holding the wires (1x13mm).&nbsp; There are a few ways to get to it, you
could use a 13mm deep socket and feel for
it.&nbsp; Its location is marked in the picture below with the red arrow.&nbsp; Here is a picture of the bracket
from behind.&nbsp; It is threaded onto the 16mm (or 17mm) long bolt that holds the starter
in place.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/mk3cable.jpg" width="780" height="313"></p>
<p>Here is another picture with the bracket installed.&nbsp; Yours may slide off
with a clip, mine had a 13mm nut resting on top of a 16mm starter/motor mount
bolt.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Like the super deluxe shop mirror?&nbsp; It's the old side view
mirror, left over from the OEM wide angle/blind spot mirror replacement, see <a href="../a4/blind-spot-mirror-mod-VW.htm">1000q:
wide angle blind spot mirror install and FAQ</a> for more details.)<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/starterback.jpg" width="746" height="488"></p>
<p>You might also be able to slip the bracket off by releasing this clip.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/starterbracket.jpg" width="938" height="345"></p>
<p>Remove the 16mm (or 17mm) long bolts holding the starter to the transmission
bellhousing (2x 16mm or 2x 17mm).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For mk3 Jetta/Passat only: these bolts are connected to the motor mount on
the other side.&nbsp; The mk4 Jetta/Golf/New Beetle does not.&nbsp; It's possible to remove them without supporting the engine
(since
there are 3 bolts in total that connect the engine to the motor mount) but it will be
difficult to put back.&nbsp; I suggest putting a wood block and jack under
the engine to hold it in place.&nbsp; After starter removal, immediately loosely
thread the bolts back in the mounts to prevent the chance of engine sag.&nbsp;
Optional: You can also use an engine support bracket from northern
tool or harbor freight, pictured below<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/enginesupport.jpg" width="711" height="267"></p>
<p>Mk4 cars need removal of a bolt holding the air conditioning bracket.&nbsp;
It is attached in the same way that the cable bracket above is attached (with a
small bolt on top of the long bolt).&nbsp; Again, if you have an mk4 you don't
need to support the engine as shown above.</p>
<p>The starter can now be removed.</p>
<p>Replacement is the reverse of removal.</p>

<p>If the (2x 16mm) starter bolts don't want to go back in, wiggle the motor mount or engine until it goes
in.&nbsp; Pictured below is the bolt and the threaded end on the motor mount
bracket. You can also loosen but do not remove the 3rd motor mount short bolt
(1x16mm) to let you move the bracket more.&nbsp; Below is an mk3, yours may look
slightly different.&nbsp; Again, mk3 and mk4 are slightly different, mk4 do not
use a motor mount there.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
