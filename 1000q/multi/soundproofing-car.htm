soundproofing to your car</h1>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b><h2>This article will show you how to add soundproofing to your car, give some
basic soundproofing theory, and list some good brands of soundproofing for cars
like dynamat, brownbread, bquiet, or raammat.</h2>
<p>Every car can benefit from additional soundproofing, even luxury cars.&nbsp;
I have found that VW diesels have more soundproofing in selective areas, but are
as lacking in soundproofing as gas VW cars.&nbsp; One of the biggest factors
distinguishing cheaper car's sound level from luxury cars is the amount of
soundproofing.&nbsp; You can add as little or as much
soundproofing as you want but like other modifications to your car, you
should have a goal.&nbsp; And don't be surprised if the radio sounds bad after
you install soundproofing.&nbsp; When you change speaker setups, it will sound
funny to your ear until you get used to it.&nbsp; It could just be that the
speakers are more accurate. (Soundproofing should not touch the speaker cones).
<h3>Basic-advanced levels of soundproofing</h3>
<p>First identify what's causing the noise.&nbsp; Is it wind noise, road
noise, engine noise, or general noise?&nbsp; A basic soundproofing job at your
local audio store will add some sound proofing around the speakers and the back of the door
panel.&nbsp; Most people would barely notice the
difference if at all.&nbsp; Results also vary by car since it requires very
exact placement and will only dampen some resonance.&nbsp; Well designed
speakers already have pretty good speaker enclosures, so a small square of
sticky mat will
make little difference.&nbsp; These are the speaker kits that are
sold at &quot;big box&quot; electronic stores with a 300% markup.</p>
<p>Most people would benefit from a moderate soundproofing.&nbsp; This address
both road noise and general noise.&nbsp; Soundproofing
the area around the wheel wells and in the doors would make a small but noticeable
difference in how quiet the car is.&nbsp; Adding closed cell foam to the doors and undercoating material to the
plastic wheel well liners are probably the best value in addition to sound deadening
mats. This is the easiest in labor because almost most should be able to do this themselves and the materials
cost should be about $200-$300.</p>
<p> Below is an example of the front plastic wheel wells, lower engine side
covers, and timing belt cover with black rubberized undercoating to address road
and engine noise.&nbsp; This significantly reduced tire and road noise from the
front wheels.&nbsp; I
wouldn't put undercoating on the inside of the timing belt cover because of belt
clearance and if it flakes off, it could damage the engine.&nbsp; I
would also avoid additional undercoating behind the car's wheel wells since it could
cover up important drainage passages.&nbsp; I've tried 3M and Duplicolor spray
on rubberized undercoating and found that it works well.&nbsp; Rustoleum
undercoating doesn't seem as thick or foam up as much as 3M and Duplicolor.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound9.JPG" width="630" height="608"></p>
<p> If you would like an even quieter interior, you could
also add material to the floor and the firewall (the area behind the
dashboard).&nbsp; This is more difficult because you would have to remove the
seats and carpeting and possibly the dashboard, but it adds the most dramatic
benefit because it quiets the engine and entire cabin.&nbsp; Coating the wheel
wells with liquid undercarriage coating and putting closed cell padding in the door is highly
recommended at this stage because it has a lower effort-benefit ratio. You will also require
about 50-100 square feet of mat soundproofing for this job and will spend about
$300-500 in materials.&nbsp; Labor costs vary according to how easily the
interior can be removed.</p>
<p>If you want an extreme quiet then get an electric car.&nbsp;
Unless you never open the windows, never rev the engine, and have a very high quality sound system, then you are going
past the point of diminishing
returns.&nbsp; To get extreme level results, just doing the doors with a high
level of soundproofing will be pointless
unless you also do the floor, dashboard, and roof since at this level, any area
that you do not do an extreme level job on will create noticeable noise.&nbsp;
Even still, you can't address the windows or other misc. sources of noise.&nbsp;
Closed cell mats are also necessary here
to achieve an extreme quiet.&nbsp; Liquid soundproofing to the inside and
outside of the wheel well liners is absolutely necessary here because no one
solution will be enough to dampen the interior without breaking up the sound at
its source before it
reaches the metal.&nbsp; To get extreme quiet, you must do
extreme soundproofing!&nbsp; The cost of this will exceed $800 in materials and definitely
over $1,000 in labor.&nbsp; Most people would not notice the additional benefits
of this level of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one advantage about doing an extreme job is that it isn't that much more
in labor than a moderate soundproofing job it's
really just a matter of more money on higher quality and more materials.&nbsp;
Instead of applying just one or two layers of soundproofing, you will cover all
holes, apply liquid soundproofing to all the areas that you couldn't reach with
the mat, and add a moisture barrier closed cell foam like ensolite foam on top of it.</p>
<p>Even for &quot;extreme jobs&quot;, you can break it down into
areas.&nbsp; You can do each door or the trunk on separate days if you are doing
it yourself.&nbsp; The only area
that requires at least a full day to do is the dashboard and the floor since you have to remove the seats and
carpeting.&nbsp; This would be a good time to clean the carpet.</p>
<h3>Soundproofing brands - what to choose?</h3>
<p>First, you need to buy the soundproofing.&nbsp; There are lots of brands out
there, so here are some tips that I have learned on soundproofing brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avoid buying retail soundproofing at the local &quot;big box&quot;
store.&nbsp; The &quot;Dy----t&quot; brand is decent quality stuff, but the worst value by far.&nbsp; There are better brands at much lower prices
from ebay or
direct from the manufacturer.&nbsp; I have also found the same exact basic
&quot;Dy----t&quot; sound deadener at mcmaster.&nbsp; Do a search
on the internet for dynamat mcmaster and their poly mastic self adhesive sound
deadening sheets.&nbsp; This is the same exact thing as &quot;Dy----t&quot; and is rated for
automotive use/temperatures.&nbsp; Their catalog changes from time to time, last I checked
they were out of stock and switched to an EVA foam sound deadening sheet with a
lower temperature rating that is not appropriate for auto use.</p>
<p>The &quot;ed--d&quot; found on ebay works well, but I would use at least two layers of the stuff to
equal better soundproofing.&nbsp; In critical sound
areas such as the doors and wheel wells, you should be prepared to use 3-4 layers.&nbsp; Even their premium level soundproofing is not as good as other
premium brand soundproofing but it's reflected in their lower price.&nbsp;
Raammat from
raamaudio as the best value for most people.&nbsp;
Unlike many makers who sell cheap, better, best grade materials, he only sells premium
stuff.&nbsp; It's also a good value because you will find yourself using less layers as a basic cover where you would use two layers of the lower quality
stuff.&nbsp; Of course, if you are like me you will end up using two
layers anyways, but it's high quality stuff.&nbsp; It is twice the price as the cheapest ebay brand, but also twice as
good.&nbsp; Since labor is the same, I would just buy the better stuff,
especially since this job only has to be done once and the difference in price
for a whole project is minimal.&nbsp; Brownbread, B-quiet, Damplifier are also
all good brands and can be found without huge markups.</p>
<p>If you insist on saving a little bit of money, I would buy a small roll of
rammat and a small roll of ebay &quot;e&quot; brand.&nbsp; The ebay
&quot;e&quot; brand can be used on less critical areas such as the roof and
trunk or as additional cover.&nbsp; However, after using ebay &quot;e&quot; brand I would buy raammat in the
future.&nbsp; The raammat has real aluminum and is hard to cut through.&nbsp;
The ebay &quot;e&quot; brand can be cut like butter with a regular pair of
scissors and has a plastic back layer.&nbsp; Less scissor resistance equals less
sound resistance.&nbsp; And the amount of money saved in the end would only be
1-2 fill ups at the gas station, so I recommend just buying the better stuff.</p>
<p>Lastly, do NOT buy asphalt based sound proofing mats or lowes/home
depot &quot;peel and seal&quot; type roofing products for interior auto use.&nbsp; They will melt off in the
summer heat and stink your car up with a tar smell.&nbsp; Once they come unglued,
they are basically useless since they aren't absorbing vibrations and if placed
in the door, could leave a black tar streak on your windows every time you lower
them.&nbsp; For the same amount of labor, just buy something that was designed
for auto temperatures and use.</p>
<p>This independent test breaks down various brands by price, quality,
etc.&nbsp; Note that some of the brands, such as edead have since switched to
butyl instead of asphalt and others have changed their prices.&nbsp; It also
includes other brands so you can educate yourself about what products are out
there.&nbsp; It can be
found here: <a href="http://www.sounddeadenershowdown.com/">http://www.sounddeadenershowdown.com/</a>
although it's dated. The listing on this (myturbodiesel) page is current.</p>
<p>For liquid soundproofing, there are products available for the interior but
these can be very messy and require multiple coats.&nbsp; For soundproofing on
the wheel wells, you can use spray on undercarriage undercoating, etc., to break
up the sound before it reaches the metal.&nbsp; 3M and Duplicolor spray on coating
work well.&nbsp; Rustoleum seems to not foam as much as 3M and Duplicolor.&nbsp;
A product called GraviTex or
truck bed liner can also act as soundproofing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should also use closed cell foam.&nbsp; If your
car already has a layer of closed cell foam in the door, go to a junkyard or buy
a new one from the dealer - it will already be perfectly preformed!&nbsp; If
not, ensolite is a very good closed cell foam.&nbsp; The
inside of the door gets wet from rain and condensation so a closed cell foam is
required to act as a moisture barrier and not get moldy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Soundproofing theory</h3>
<p>To help you decide where and how much soundproofing to apply, here is some
basic theory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> The first is mass loading. This is what your basic soundproofing mats do.
The
idea is to add weight to whatever it is you're trying to dampen.&nbsp; By doing this,
you change it's resonant frequency and decrease it's likelihood to vibrate.&nbsp;
It
also absorbs some vibrations and converts it to low level heat.&nbsp; Don't
worry, it won't heat up your car, the process of absorbing energy creates
heat.&nbsp; Sound = energy, when absorbed, it is converted to heat.&nbsp; This is good for vibration
damping but blocks only little sound.&nbsp; This is where the ebay brands are
most effective.&nbsp; This is also what the liquid soundproofing materials' best
purpose is.</p>
<p>The second type of damping is called barrier loading.
Unlike mass loading, barrier loading does block a significant amount of sound.&nbsp;
Usually what these have is a sandwich of materials, some
neoprene rubber or foam, and some acoustic lead or other metal powder.&nbsp; These
also turn vibrations into heat and absorb the acoustical energy of sound waves.&nbsp;
This is where the raammat is a huge improvement over the ebay &quot;e&quot;
brand.&nbsp; The raammat uses a thicker butyl layer and an aluminum backing
where the ebay brand uses a thinner butyl layer with a plastic backing.&nbsp;
You can add two layers of the cheaper stuff to get a thicker layer, but you
still don't have that aluminum layer to turn sound into heat.</p>
<p>Absorbing is the final layer where air vibrations are absorbed.&nbsp; Ensolite is an excellent product for
this and the only one that I would recommend for auto use.&nbsp; Do not use open
celled foams because they will absorb water, rot, and fall apart.&nbsp; In fact,
the Mk3 passat already had one layer of closed celled foam in the door, the Mk4
jetta does not.&nbsp; If you have a car that already has a closed cell foam
layer, search an auto recycler (junkyard) for an extra sheet of closed cell foam
- the advantage is that it will be cheaper and be perfectly pre-formed!&nbsp; The door has water pass through it, so it is extremely important
to use only closed cell foam and seal all of the edges as a moisture
barrier.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reduce the amount of sound these have to absorb you want to reflect it before it's
absorbed.&nbsp; Use spray on truck bed liner or
undercoating to coat the inside of the wheel wells.&nbsp; Try to put tape over
any screws or access holes so that they aren't covered up and avoid blocking any
drainage passages.&nbsp; This will make
a big difference in road noise levels because you can't otherwise do much about tire noise
or road noise.&nbsp; As pictured above and here again, I put it on the plastic
wheel well liners.&nbsp; This turns the almost useless plastic wheel well liners
into a significant sound absorber/reflector.&nbsp; You might not notice too much
difference until it's raining and the sound of water hitting the wheel well is
different.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound9.JPG" width="630" height="608"></p>
<p>Lastly, mat soundproofing is best for dampening low frequency noises, but
road noises have a lot of mid and high frequency components.&nbsp; A well
engineered soundproofing job would also use minimal materials by placing the
soundproofing in select spots to dampen the metal resonance.&nbsp; The engineers
who made your car have probably already placed some select soundproofing but it could always be
improved.</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>First remove the trim where you want to work.&nbsp; Refer to the below trim removal
articles for more details.<a href="../a3b4/passat-door-card-panel-removal.htm"><br>

<p>
<a href="../a5/door-skin-jetta-remove.htm">1000q: mk5 VW Jetta door skin removal</a></p>
<p>Then clean the interior where mat is to be applied.&nbsp; This is extremely important!&nbsp; Clean it
until you wipe with a clean paper towel and it comes back perfectly clean.&nbsp; If there
is dust, oil, or dirt on the surface, the sound deadener will not stick
properly.&nbsp; Not only will it not do its job of absorbing sound, but if it is
applied to an area like the inside of the door panel, it may smear all over the
window if it falls off, causing black tar streaks on the window each time you
raise the glass.</p>
<p>Test fit a panel and cut it as necessary.&nbsp; Use smaller strips rather
than larger strips, especially on curved surfaces because it will help lessen the chance of bubbles and
wrinkles.&nbsp; Add another layer as necessary.&nbsp; The bottom layer is what
sticks directly to the surface, so make sure it is as smooth
and bubble free as possible!&nbsp; Small pieces can be more easily applied
smoothly.&nbsp; Areas such as the wheel
wells, firewall, and the doors need more than one layer of soundproofing,&nbsp;
I would add at least two layers.&nbsp; If you are using lower quality
soundproofing, I would use at least four layers in heavy areas for best results.</p>
<p>If you are doing a higher end job, cover all the holes with soundproofing and
put a layer of ensolite or other closed cell foam between the door and door
panel.&nbsp; Avoid putting the foam on the exterior door panel since it acts
like a moisture barrier, could interfere with the power window, and is not the
most economical use of the foam since it's expensive..&nbsp; Make sure that all wires are
protected from chafing and that all door handles and windows, etc, can move freely.&nbsp; Make sure to avoid areas around the edge of trim panels/securing clips/screws
and close to the window track, and other areas where clearance is needed for the
trim and door panel to fit back properly.</p>
<p>Use a roller to make sure it is stuck well.&nbsp; No stick = no absorption of
energy.&nbsp; If you didn't read the earlier section on why you shouldn't use
roofing peel and stick products in your car, go back and read it now - they
don't work well and they smell bad, so don't use them!</p>

<p>That's about it!&nbsp; Again, if you are doing a basic job, you can use less
material and just stick with mat.&nbsp; If you want a high end job, use more
layers of sticky mat and use a layer of ensolite on top of everything.&nbsp; For the hard to
reach areas, apply liquid soundproofing as necessary.</p>

<p>Here is a before picture.&nbsp; Note that the rear quarter panel comes stock
with only 1
small square of sound absorbing material.&nbsp; My guess is that the VW
engineers decided that this was the most efficient spot to put
soundproofing.&nbsp; The reason they don't use more is because saving even a
little soundproofing can save a lot of money.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it blocks
only the most obvious vibration.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Here is an after picture - I used too large of a piece on the wheel well so I
had to make relief cuts to relieve the tension and get it to conform.&nbsp; This is what it should not look like on the wheel wells!&nbsp; The
flat areas look better.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound2.jpg" width="640" height="480">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note the green vacuum line for the power door locks - try to avoid covering
lines and electrical wires.&nbsp; Remember, the dampening material works by absorbing
vibration, if you are doing a more extreme job, you can cover those spots with
foam so the lines will still be accessible later.&nbsp; This time I used more manageable pieces to avoid having
to make sloppy relief cuts.&nbsp; Remember, adding undercoating to the tire side
of the wheel wells can reduce road noise by preventing it from reaching the
metal in the first place.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound3.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>The seating and cabin area is very important.&nbsp; I would like to add more
soundproofing to the area under the carpeting later.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound4.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>The large spare tire panel is not covered but this can be done later without pulling the interior plastic panels.&nbsp; It
also already has foam padding on the underside.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound5.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>This is an ensolite like closed cell foam that comes stock on the passat
and not on a jetta.&nbsp; It's one of the reasons why a passat is quieter.&nbsp; It's
also a water repelling moisture barrier
because the inside of the door gets wet!&nbsp; If it gets torn it should be taped up
again to prevent water leaks.&nbsp; If you already have a closed cell foam layer,
I suggest going to a junkyard or buying another layer from a dealer
(expensive).&nbsp; It'll be already formed perfectly and will make a big difference in speaker
quality and sound levels.&nbsp; If not, you can add a layer of closed cell foam
here.&nbsp; It's not recommended to put the foam on the exterior door
sheet metal, only between the interior door metal and the door panel.&nbsp; This
is because it can fall off onto the window if it's not stuck on well.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound6.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Below is a picture of a same generation jetta - there is no sound absorbing
foam, only a thin plastic moisture barrier.&nbsp; Later jetta used a thicker
board with a few foam blocks.&nbsp; The yellow foam is all the dampening the
speakers get.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a3b4/interior/jet6.jpg" width="900" height="574"></p>

<p>The outside panel is important.&nbsp; Clean it, clean it, then clean it
again or else the soundproofing will not stick!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unless you are doing a high level job, just cover as much as you can. There's
so much engine and noise that comes through the window and roof that it's difficult to get it
super quiet unless you
tear apart the dashboard and floor too.&nbsp; Remember, the purpose of the
sticky mat is to change the resonance - it's not a foam layer!&nbsp; Sticky mat
is best on metal.&nbsp; Be careful
that the mats don't interfere with the edges of the door panel and handle screw
points, etc.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound7.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>The door panel can benefit a little from soundproofing too, but adding
dampening material to the metal and adding a foam layer are the most important
things you can do for a basic-medium level job.&nbsp; I had some left over and I doubt it
made much difference.&nbsp; A foam layer for the door card should be more effective than
sticky mat.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sound8.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Overall, I did notice a difference.&nbsp; After adding the sound deadener there was a small
improvement in sound quality from the stock sound system.&nbsp; Highway noise
was also reduced.&nbsp; The sound of the tires and water splashing during a rain
storm was reduced.&nbsp; Tapping on the outside metal skin of the door produced a dull sound instead of a tingy sound.&nbsp; Shutting the door also
sounded very solid.&nbsp; Again, don't expect magic if you only add a few pieces
of mat to the doors and trunk because a medium level job means medium level
results!&nbsp; But if you are already removing the door panels to do other
maintenance work, adding soundproofing while you are in there is a great idea.</p>
