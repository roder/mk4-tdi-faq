<p><font size="4"><b>Introduction
</b></font>
<h2>This article shows how to replace the fuel injection pump seal on a Bosch VE VW TDI or Audi TDI</h2>
<p>Seals can leak due to age or switching from a high percentage of biodiesel to regular ULSD ultra low sulfur diesel. Many old pumps also leaked when the US government required all pump diesel to be ULSD by 2010. Make sure you buy a quality seal kit! Don't buy a cheap knock-off seal kit - if the price is too good to be true it is!</p>
<p>If you need to remove the injection pump from the car, please refer to the timing belt articles here and either article on removing or swapping the pump: <a href="../a3b4/injection-pump-alh-swap-repair-tdi.htm">1000q: mk3 injection pump removal or ALH pump swap</a> or <a href="../a4/IP-removal-TDI-engine.htm">1000q: mk4 injection pump removal</a>. Please thoroughly read each article for the best understanding of how it's attached and the adjustments to pump position and timing.</p>
<p>If you only need to replace the very top quantity adjuster seal or fuel temperature sensor, see <a href="fuel-temperature-sensor-TDI.htm">1000q: top cover replacment</a>. When you're done, here is more detail on how to adjust the quantity adjuster position: <a href="IQ-adjust-hammer-mod-TDI.htm">1000q: hammer mod and IQ adjustment</a>. Do not run the car without checking the quantity adjuster because without control over the quanity of fuel injected, the car won't run right. The VCDS cable is required! If you decide that the pump needs to be rebuilt, send it to a Bosch authorized shop for a total rebuild. They will also replace all seals at that time.</p>

<p>As an interesting side note, using biodiesel can sometimes stop a small leak because it swells the seals. You will have to continue to use biodiesel and going off biodiesel will cause the leak to return. Biodiesel will also clean out the buildup in the fuel system so it's recommended to change the fuel filter early at least once or twice depending on how dirty the fuel system is. If the fuel filter clogs it will cause fuel starvation. Here is a video showing the basics:</p>
