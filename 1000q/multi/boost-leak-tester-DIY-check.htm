How to check for boost leaks on your engine
intake or intercooler - also works for vacuum leaks</h1>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2><b>What is a boost leak and how to find it?&nbsp;</b> &nbsp;</h2>
<p> A boost leak is an air leak in the intake path downstream of the <a href="maf-faq-tdi.htm"> mass air flow sensor
(MAS or MAF</a>) and before the engine cylinders.&nbsp; Because the car's
computer fuels the engine based on (largely) the amount of air measured by the
air flow sensor, air leaking out causes the incorrect ratio of air to
fuel.&nbsp; Leaking air also causes the turbo to work harder than it should,
causing further loss of performance.&nbsp; A diesel engine can operate well on a wider air/fuel
range than a gasoline
engine so they aren't as sensitive to boost leaks, but a boost leak
check will maximize fuel efficiency and power.&nbsp; Before spending time
and money tracking mystery problems on the car, you should first have your car
scanned for error codes and if it's turbocharged or supercharged, have a boost leak check
done.</p>
<p>It's called a boost leak instead of a vacuum leak because it appears when the engine is under boost from
the turbo or supercharger.&nbsp; The turbo and supercharger pressurize the air
in the intake path when the engine is boosting so if there's a leak, it will
flow out instead of in.&nbsp; When the engine is not boosting, the leak can
become a vacuum leak.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some newer gasoline cars and most
diesel cars don't have throttle plates and will not create a
strong vacuum between the turbo and the intake manifold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>VW diesels have separate vacuum pumps to make vacuum for the brake booster.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most gasoline cars have vacuum lines tapped from the intake manifold for
the brake booster.</p>
<p>A
gasoline engine will show more symptoms of a vacuum leak at idle since they
will not idle smoothly, will misfire, or detonate.&nbsp; While under boost, a
forced induction gasoline engine will lose power from excess fuel and can puff a
little smoke from the rich condition.&nbsp; Turbodiesel engine leaks show up
while under boost in the form of lost power and economy, higher than normal
EGT, an overworked turbo, and excess smoke from the overfueling condition.</p>
<p>Turbo engines are more vulnerable to boost leaks because of more
piping and hose connections vs. a nonturbo engine.&nbsp; The hoses are also
exposed to greater heat and
positive pressure which can cause them to work loose, dry out and crack hoses, or
rubbing through and make a hole.&nbsp; Even a loose motor mount
can cause
excessive engine movement and hide a cracked hose that leaks only when the
engine twists it.&nbsp; (When the car accelerates heavily the engine torque
causes the engine to twist slightly on the engine mounts).&nbsp; Boost leaks are another reason why
<a href="../turbocharging2.htm#diyT">
adding a turbo to your non turbo car</a> can cause unforeseen problems.&nbsp; Boost and positive pressure on these seals can
create leaks that aren't there under vacuum because the seals, etc., were
designed to only seal under vacuum or very low boost levels.&nbsp; A boost leak
test will reveal them.</p>
<p> A boost leak test's advantages over a visual inspection
is that it can be faster if the leak is hidden from view or only shows up under
some circumstances.&nbsp; In some cases it's faster to just look in the
engine bay for broken or loose couplers/hoses but a boost
leak check will show even small leaks under pressure and without getting under
the car or removing the belly shield.&nbsp; In the case of a small crack on the
intercooler, it's very difficult to spot a small crack by visual inspection
while it's on the car.&nbsp; I also suggest looking for sooty spray (on a TDI
you can expect some oil in the intake piping) or
shaking the hoses as a quick visual inspection before doing a boost leak check.&nbsp;
Also, a boost leak test is
not a leakdown test, a leakdown test is different.</p>
<p>Common places for a boost leak in the TDI are in the hose couplers, lower
intercooler piping, EGR piping, and broken vacuum lines.&nbsp; In the mk3 jetta,
one of the elbow couplers tends to split near the rear, probably because it's
closest to the exhaust manifold.&nbsp; All TDI can leak where the EGR piping
goes into the intake.&nbsp; Also check near the intercooler piping since it's
out of view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example of a boost leak test being performed.&nbsp; If you listen
carefully, you can hear air hissing as it's being pressurized and not leveling
off.&nbsp; This means
the air is leaking out somewhere.&nbsp; Normally the intake tract is
pressurized within a few seconds and the sound of the air changes.&nbsp; The
user stops adding air as well.&nbsp; Don't be afraid
to turn up the sound (it's not a trick, I promise!)

<p>Again, I suggest looking for sooty spray or shaking the hoses as a first step
before doing a boost leak check because you could spot the problem right
away.&nbsp; It's normal for a little bit of oil to be around the couplers on a TDI and
normal for the inside of the boost hoses to be oily on a TDI because of a
diesel's greater engine blowby.&nbsp; Gasoline engine boost hoses should be dry
or almost dry. Here is an example of a TDI intercooler which was leaking through the end caps. A spray bottle used during the boost leak test easily verified the leak.<br><iframe width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/j6hbFbflR0w?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<h2>DIY home made boost leak tester</h2>
<p>Your basic boost leak tester should have a gauge and a way to get air
in.&nbsp; Personally, I use a thick piece of plastic bag and clamp it over the
air intake hose (where the air filter exits).&nbsp; As the intake is
pressurized, the plastic stretches out.&nbsp; If it stays under tension there's
no leak.&nbsp; If the plastic immediately sags, there's a leak.&nbsp; If it doesn't inflate at all there's a major leak or a hole in the
plastic bag.&nbsp; If you want to measure the rate of leaking you need a
gauge.&nbsp; NOTE - the examples below are generic examples only, change the
pipe diameter to fit your car.&nbsp; (<font size="1">pictures from
http://www.stealth316.com/2-pressuretester.htm and http://www.mirage-performance.com/EclipseGSX/BoostLeaks/index.html</font>)&nbsp;<br>

<p>This leak tester uses a tire valve stem (schrader valve) to pressurize the
intake piping.&nbsp; This tester is just a coupler clamped around a PVC
cap.&nbsp; Just
remember that it should be quiet to detect an air leak.&nbsp; Below right is a
video showing how to make your own DIY boost leak tester. </p>

<h2>Using your boost leak tester and how to do a boost leak test
</h2>
<p> On a cool and shut off engine (not running), close the intake system by removing the piping at some point
immediately downstream of&nbsp; the MAS/MAF sensor.&nbsp; Attach your boost leak
tester or clamp a piece of durable plastic
bag over the piping to form an airtight seal.&nbsp;&nbsp;This spot that I marked
below with a green arrow is a good spot because there's a clamp already there
that you can use to clamp the bag.&nbsp; All other cars are similar.&nbsp; Just pick any spot downstream of the
air intake.&nbsp;
If you want to see the leak rate, tap a spot with an air pressure gauge or make
your own tester as shown earlier.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Any vacuum line that directly taps into the intake path will
work.&nbsp; If you have a VW TDI, don't use a vacuum line that leads to the EGR because it's separated
from the intake path by a diaphragm.&nbsp; The line from the N75 boost valve to
the intake will work.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/boostleak1.jpg" width="640" height="390"></p>

<p>Always regulate your compressed air down to about 5 psi.&nbsp; This is enough to
let you detect the boost leak and not blow out the plastic bag clamped over the
intake.&nbsp; It also should not blow out any oil seals on the engine because
your TDI already sees pressure in the crankcase from the vacuum pump exhaust and
piston blowby. </p>

<p>If there's a PCV or CCV hose coming off the valve cover (top of the engine)
that connects to the air intake, plug the end that's on the air intake
off.&nbsp; That hose is to vent crankcase pressure and is not subjected to pressure during normal
driving.&nbsp; Many TDI have no hose clamp there so if there isn't, just block
it off.<script type="text/javascript"><!--

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/airnozzle.jpg" align="right" width="171" height="108">
Use a compressed air nozzle like the one pictured right or connect your boost
leak tester.&nbsp; Apply the air into
any vacuum tube that leads into the intake tract or into your boost leak tester.&nbsp;
This will pressurize the intake tract as if your engine was under boost.&nbsp;
Again, if you
go to 10 psi or higher, clamp or close off any hoses that don't see a lot of pressure,
such as the CCV (crank case vent, similar to PCV, it's the black puck on valve
cover).&nbsp; You must use compressed
air from a tank and not a bicycle pump or anything that makes noise&nbsp;while you are doing
the test, otherwise you won't be able to hear the hissing noise of the air leaks.
</p>
<p>
Listen for any hissing noise - this will indicate a boost leak.&nbsp; If it's
not holding any pressure at all then there is a major leak somewhere.&nbsp; No
noise means no leaks.&nbsp; Try wiggling the intake or vacuum hoses to aggravate
and identify a
loose connection.&nbsp; In rare cases a bad motor mount could cause excessive
movement and pull loose a hose during hard acceleration.
</p>

<p>If you have aftermarket camshafts with a long duration, this may
cause the intake and exhaust valves to not be completely sealed (more applicable
to gasoline engines), creating a path
for the air to leak out.&nbsp; Diesel engines typically have little to no
overlap so it should not be an issue
for diesel engines.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br><iframe width="480" height="390" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/s29Q77hK-i4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>Why not use soapy water to find an air leak?&nbsp; Hydrolock is unlikely
since air pressure should be pushing any water out of the intake tract and you can hear air escaping pretty
easily so I don't bother with soapy water.&nbsp; In addition, since the intake
tract has to be under pressure, which means you already have a compressor, soapy
water is more effort than necessary.&nbsp; If you can't hear and feel the air escaping then it's not a
significant leak.&nbsp; A smoke puffer or thin strip of paper can also help you
find a leak.
</p>
<p>You can use a thin strip of paper or no-residue smoke puffer to waft around where you think the leak is.&nbsp; The
thin strip of paper or smoke should help you locate the
leak.</p>

<h3>Common boost leak locations on the VW TDI or Audi TDI engine </h3>

<p>
A3 Jetta - check the backside of the elbow on the driver's side intake piping -
that rubber pipe is near the EGR (exhaust) piping and can dry out and crack.&nbsp;
The various couplers can also come loose.<br>
A4 New Beetle, Jetta, Golf - the hose coming off the turbo or the hose for the
intercooler seems to have some issues.&nbsp; The various couplers can also come
loose.&nbsp; The quick connect tabs on the rubber hose at the intake manifold
tend to wear down and pop out.<br>
B5-Passat - there's a few hoses behind the bumper that use quick connect
couplings which can pop out.&nbsp; The hoses could also rub against one of the
ground wires and cause a hole.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h3>What's not a boost leak </h3>

<p>Here is a video of a leak on the exhaust side on a Golf TDI.&nbsp; It is
provided as an example of what isn't a boost leak.&nbsp; In this
example, the bolts for the EGR were removed and were not tightened.&nbsp; The
sound is more choppy and scattered that what you would expect with a boost
leak.&nbsp; Exhaust side noise upstream of the turbo is more choppy because of
the exhaust pulses.&nbsp; Downstream of the turbo, exhaust leaks tend to sound
smoother since the turbo chops up the air and smoothes out the noise.&nbsp;
Lastly, if you are hearing a noise while driving, your noise could be a bad
pulley on the serpentine belt, or some other non-intake related noise.&nbsp;
It's very hard to hear a boost leak on the highway over road and engine noise and
most don't notice a leak until they have a drivability or smoke issue. </p>
