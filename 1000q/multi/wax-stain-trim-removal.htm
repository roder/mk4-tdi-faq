<h2>This shows how to remove white wax stains from the black trim on your car</h2>
<p>If you regularly wash and wax your car, you have probably gotten some wax or
polish on the trim.&nbsp; Once it bakes in the sun, it will set into the trim
and cause a white stain.&nbsp; Good detailing is all in the details, so
restoring the trim will make a big improvement in the appearance of your
car.&nbsp; The below picture is an example of trim that has been half
restored.&nbsp; This cannot be achieved by just washing or scrubbing the trim.&nbsp;
To prevent wax stains in the first place, wipe off wax if it gets on trim or
tape ff the trim before polishing/waxing.</p>
<p>As trim ages, I've noticed that it gets dried out and the micro scratches
cause trim to become more susceptible to wax stains.&nbsp; If it's really bad,
replacing the trim with brand new trim will make a big difference in the
appearance of the car.&nbsp; Below is an example of white wax stains on trim and
an &quot;after&quot; of restoring the trim to black.</p>

<p>paper towels<br>
wax remover - gr-40 from topoftheline works well (I haven't tried wax
blaster or peanut butter as wax remover but I hear it works - the oils soften
the wax.&nbsp; 3M also sells adhesive and wax remover for cars.)<br>
<br>
painter's tape<br>
black restore or black forever (optional)</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>
<p>Tape off all the paint next to the trim.&nbsp; Do not skip this step, you
don't want the black dye to get onto the paint!</p>
<p>Clean the trim with wax remover and a paper towel.&nbsp; Repeat as necessary. </p>
<p>Let dry and see if it's dark enough.&nbsp; If you want it darker, apply black restore or
black forever.&nbsp; Because you taped off the paint, it lets you apply the
black color safely to the edges of the trim.</p>
<p>Let dry and remove the tape.&nbsp; Let the black color set in and well after
it sets, you can wipe down the
trim with a paper towel to remove any black color that didn't adhere properly.</p>
<p>Before - the soft rubber trim here was vulnerable to wax
stains because it gets baked by the sun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After - not 100%, but much better.&nbsp; Since the trim is on the top of the
car it gets the most sun exposure and is weather worn.&nbsp; Additional coats of black applied
later can helped.</p>
