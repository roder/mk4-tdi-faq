<h2>This article shows how to DIY install an ipod adapter, aux-in cable for mp3
  player, or usb or mini usb cable, for all mk4 VW 1998-2011 and newer and MDI FAQ</h2>
<p>Because there are so many aftermarket solutions, this page shows mostly OEM
  radio or GPS navigation system compatibility.&nbsp; Most of these items apply to
  Golf, Jetta, New Beetle, Eos, and Tiguan.&nbsp; The Tiguan is basically a
Jetta.&nbsp; For Touareg specific information, see the bottom.</p>
<h3>aux-in, ipod, and mp3 adapter types for VW:</h3>
<h4>3.5mm jack</h4>
<p>This is a standard headphone jack.&nbsp; It'll play
music clearly but it doesn't allow mp3 player control or charge their battery.&nbsp;
You cannot splice them into CD changer wiring except on 2007 or later because
the radios used a CD changer detect logic.&nbsp; Cars 2007-2009 had an option of
aux-in or iPod dock.&nbsp; The 2007-2009 aux-in is better due to the limitations of
the iPod adapter.&nbsp; If you retrofit the <a href="../a6/rns315-GPS-FAQ-VW.htm">RNS315
GPS navigation radio</a> there's a plug on the front of the headunit.&nbsp; When
using these you have to turn up the volume on the mp3 player to the maximum so
that the radio gets a loud signal input.</p>
<h4>FM modulator</h4>
<p>This sends your mp3 signal over a short range FM radio transmitter.&nbsp; You
tune the radio to a specific frequency to pick it up.&nbsp; Static is a common
problem.&nbsp; I would get an aux-in before trying these.&nbsp; VW doesn't make
or sell these at dealers as a factory part.</p>
<h4>ISA iPod adapter VW# 1k0 051 510 a (1k0051510a)</h4>
<p>The <b>i</b>Pod <b>S</b>atellite <b>A</b>dapter is a VW part that piggybacks on the satellite
radio signal and does not remove any external CD changer, sat radio, or aux-in.&nbsp; It only works with the premium 7
radio.&nbsp; It does work with the factory Volk-L bluetooth.&nbsp; It can show
up to 250 playlists, and up to 16 characters of artist/song text info on the radio or instrument cluster
multifunction display.&nbsp; It can also do song shuffle and scan.&nbsp; While
using it, the iPod is locked and the sat radio is bypassed.&nbsp; The picture below shows what the screen
looks like when using the iPod.</p>
<p>If you have internet radio on your iPhone, it will play over the radio.</p>
<p>The only major limitation is that it will not fast forward/reverse in the
track.&nbsp; If you are in shuffle mode and decide to stop shuffle (like if you
want to listen to the remainder of the album that the song belongs to), it
starts the album at song #1.&nbsp; Obviously, it won't play satellite while the
iPod is plugged in since it's substituting the signal.</p>
<p> If you have the premium 7 and don't want to upgrade to the 2010 and newer
radios, this is what I would
get.&nbsp; It will charge 12V iPod so if you have a newer iPod with 5V,
see the note below about the voltage step down adapter.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-isa-ipod-cable.jpg" alt="vw premium 7 ipod isa adapter cable" width="1053" height="350"></p>
<p>Retail pictures advertising it normally show the stock photo below.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-isa-ipod-adapter.jpg" alt="OEM vw isa ipod kit" width="595" height="216"></p>
<h4>iPod armrest dock VW# 1k0 857 825 e (1k0857825e) or 1k0857925e</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-ipod-dock.jpg" align="right" width="600" height="338">This
replaces the 6 CD changer that is either under the center armrest or in the
glovebox.&nbsp; It was optional 2006-2009 for mk5 cars.&nbsp;
It emulates the CD changer.&nbsp; It's the same as the mk4 iPod kit below but in dock
form.&nbsp; It should work on all mk4, I tested it on a 2005 and it worked fine.  The first 5 CDs will act as the first 5 playlists in
alphabetical order.&nbsp; The 6th
CD will act like all the other playlists.&nbsp; It will fast forward/reverse
individual tracks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The part with suffix 825e will charge only 12V iPod so if you have a newer iPod with 5V,
see the note above about the voltage step down adapter or get the 925e suffix
part.&nbsp; It
can't show artist, etc. information because it emulates and substitutes the CD
changer.&nbsp; You cannot have both the iPod adapter and OEM CD changer.&nbsp;
The iPod controls won't work when the dock is in use.</p>
<p>Since the mk4 ipod kit says that Volk-L Bluetooth 1k0 051
447(1k0051447) or 1k0051447a&nbsp; (1k0 051 447 a) will not work with it and
this is basically the same thing, I believe this limitation also applies to the
armrest dock.</p>
<p>If your car has the <a href="../a5/mfd2-GPS-FAQ-VW.htm">MFD2 OEM GPS system</a>,
it's plug and play after you remove the CD changer.&nbsp; If you have a Passat,
open the glovebox and pull the CD changer down.</p>
<p>If your car has the premium 7 radio this factory option replaced the Aux-in.</p>
<p>See <a href="../a5/install-ipod-2006-jetta-tdi.htm">1000q: iPod dock
installation</a> for detailed instructions and specs on this dock.</p>
<h4>Media bay armrest console</h4>
<p>If your car has the 6cd changer or MDI under the armrest, it has the media
bay armrest, shown above.&nbsp; If it doesn't it has the armrest shown below.&nbsp;
Golf and mk5 Jetta had the aux-in on the outside of the armrest.&nbsp; Later
sportwagen had the aux-in in the armrest cubby.&nbsp; An example is shown
below.&nbsp; If you have the non media bay armrest you could hack it apart to
fit a media bay but it would look horrible.&nbsp; I suggest buying a used
armrest instead.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/media-bay-armrest.jpg" width="506" height="250"></p>
<h4>MDI controller</h4>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-mdi-kit.jpg" align="right" width="368" height="230">VW's <b>M</b>edia <b>D</b>evice <b>I</b>nterface.&nbsp;
This was available starting in 2009 but you must have at least the RCD 310 (base Canadian radio w/o multimedia
package or European radio),
RCD 510 radio (premium 8, standard 2010 or newer), <a href="../a5/rns510-VW-GPS-FAQ.htm"> RNS
510</a>, or <a href="../a6/rns315-GPS-FAQ-VW.htm"> RNS 315</a> navigation system
to use these.&nbsp; If you retrofit one of these radios it will work on any mk5
or newer car.&nbsp; Sellers normally use the stock photo shown right.</p>
<p>The MDI is a VW part designed to work with the car's computers and will display detailed artist,
playlist, title, etc.
information, on the radio and/or instrument cluster multifunction display.&nbsp;
It gives full control and info for the iPod.&nbsp; It can also charge
the ipod or other device.&nbsp; It allows mp3 player control using the radio or steering
wheel mounted buttons (if equipped).&nbsp; While using it, the iPod is locked.</p>
<p>The iPod adapter cable plugs into the MDI controller.&nbsp; If you want a USB,
mini USB, or aux-in, you just unplug the MDI adapter and plug in the new MDI
adapter with the correct end.&nbsp; The part numbers are
below.</p>
<p>The MDI is located in either the glovebox or under the center
console armrest.&nbsp; If it's in the glovebox you have the regular armrest
cubby shown above.&nbsp; If your MDI is in the armrest you have the media bay
armrest.&nbsp; There are 3 versions, VW# 5n0 035 341 b (5n0035341b),
5n0035342b (5n0
035 342 b), and&nbsp; 5n0 035 341c (5n0035341c).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-mdi.jpg" alt="vw mdi adapter ipod" width="600" height="344"></p>
<p>They were originally installed in a piece of trim which sits in the media bay
of the armrest.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-mdi-kit-2.jpg" alt="vw mdi kit" width="784" height="360"></p>
<p>The newer ones are installed in the glovebox from the factory.&nbsp; The
retrofit kit is also sold to fit in the passenger
side glovebox.&nbsp; If you retrofit it, you also need the
wiring adapter.&nbsp; If you wish to install this style of MDI in
a media bay armrest, the adapter (the rectangular black trim visible above trim) to fit it in there
may be 1k0 864 255
c (1k0864255c).&nbsp; It could also be 5n0 035 344 a (5n0035344a) as seen in the
above picture.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-mdi-ipod.jpg" alt="OEM vw mdi ipod cable" width="846" height="364"></p>
<h4>iPod 12V to 5V OEM VW voltage step down adapter</h4>
<p>Early iPod used 12V to charge their batteries.&nbsp; Newer iPod use 5V to
charge.&nbsp; You won't damage your iPod if you plug one into a cable designed
for the other, it just won't charge.&nbsp; VW sells one - the part number is 000
051 443 c (000051443c).&nbsp; The VW adapter will also work on any aftermarket
adapters since it's just an adapter and not unique to VW radios.&nbsp; You can
probably find an aftermarket equivalent.</p>
<p>4th gen Nano, 2g Touch, and 3g iPhone, or newer all use 5V.&nbsp; Classic
iPod still use 12V.</p>
<hr>
<h3> mk4 (1998-2006) VW ipod adapter cable - 1k0051444</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vw-ipod-adapter.jpg" align="right" width="295" height="194">There are two OEM options. The mk5 dock is plug-play if your car is prewired for the 6cd changer. The dock is meant to sit in the armrest of the mk5 but since the 6cd changer sits in a cubby in the trunk, it won't look too bad. The other OEM cable that will work is VW# 1k0051444 (1k0 051
444).&nbsp; The
exception is the New Beetle, see below.&nbsp; Volk-L Bluetooth 1k0 051
447(1k0051447) or 1k0051447a&nbsp; (1k0 051 447 a) will not work with it.&nbsp; The stock photo shown
right is for this cable.&nbsp; For some reason, their stock photo is always of a
Touareg with tan interior with an iPod classic plugged in.&nbsp; (The stock
photo of the MDI adapter kit is a black interior car).</p>
<p>If you have a mk4 VW (up to 2005/2006 Jetta, Golf, New Beetle, and
Passat), you must have a radio that has the 6 cd changer control ability to use
the OEM ipod adapter.&nbsp; This includes the premium 5, premium 5.5, premium 6,
entry radio, or MFD (cd or dvd version).&nbsp; This doesn't mean that the car
has to be prewired for the CD changer, it just means that the head unit has to
have a CD changer port on the back.</p>
<p>The adapter emulates the OEM cd changer, if
equipped.&nbsp; The first 5 CDs will act as the first 5 playlists in
alphabetical order.&nbsp; The 6th
CD will act like all the other playlists.&nbsp; It will fast forward/reverse
individual tracks.&nbsp; It will charge 12V iPod so if you have a newer iPod with 5V,
see hte note above about the voltage step down adapter.&nbsp; It cannot show artist, etc. information because it emulates and substitutes the CD
changer.&nbsp; You cannot have both the ipod adapter and OEM CD changer. Here is what it looks like on the radio: The interface looks the same as if you were using a cd changer.<br>
<img src="../../images/b5/mk4-ipod-adapter.jpg" alt="mk4 jetta ipod dock" width="931" height="300"></p>
<p>If you have a new Beetle 2003 or later with the premium 5.5 radio, VW says
  that can
  use the VW ISA kit.&nbsp; This substitutes or piggybacks on the satellite radio
  signal.&nbsp; The part number is VW 1k0 051 510 a
  (1k0051510a).&nbsp; It can access up to 250 playlists, show up to 16
  characters on the radio for artist name/song, and playlist up to 8
  characters.&nbsp; It will charge 12V ipod so if you have a 5V ipod you need the
voltage step down adapter mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>You can also use a Phatbox.&nbsp; This is a hard drive that emulates a CD
changer.&nbsp; It's not a bad unit but I wouldn't buy one because a small
handheld mp3 player with the iPod cable does everything the phatbox can do and a
lot more.&nbsp; It's also a lot more portable and can be used outside of the
car.</p>

<h3>Mk5 (2005.5-2010), mk6 (2010-present), and newer ipod adapter cables, for Jetta, Tiguan, Eos,
Passat, CC, and Golf</h3>
<p>If you have a mk5 VW (2005/2006-2009/2010 Jetta, Rabbit, Passat, Eos, or
Tiguan/Touareg) without an MDI, you can still use the mk3/mk4 ipod cable.&nbsp; The exact OEM
cable depends on what radio or navigation system you have.&nbsp; See below for a
more detailed break down.</p>
<p>All VW and Audi TDI 2010 and later came with an MDI controller w/iPod adapter and aux-in 3.5mm
jack in the center console or glovebox so changing the adapter to something like
a mini usb is plug-play.</p>
<p>This chart below is for North America.&nbsp; If you are in Europe, the RNS
310 and RCD 310 is also MDI compatible.</p>

<p><b>Note 1:</b> Jetta and New Beetle that were built sometime during late 2006 (not
model year, build date) started showing up with 3.5mm aux-in ports in the
glovebox or under the dashboard console area.&nbsp; Many Jetta were sold with a
promotional guitar that plugged into this port.&nbsp; It later moved to the
center armrest.</p>
<p><b>Note 2:</b> Early MDI were under the center armrest and took up the CD changer
slot.&nbsp; Late MDI and Touareg MDI used a smaller unit that sat in the
glovebox.&nbsp; The Late MDI may not be compatible with RNS510 built before
2-1-2008 and/or with firmware lower than 1100.&nbsp; 2010-2011 Golf MDI were
under the armrest.&nbsp; The 2011 Sportwagen MDI was moved into the glovebox.</p>
<p><b>Note 3:</b> 2011 Sportwagens moved the aux-in from the outside of the center
console/armrest to the inside of the armrest cubby (I think) and the MDI to the glovebox.&nbsp; 2010
Jetta, 2010 wagons, and 2010-2011 Golf have it on the outside of the center
armrest console and the MDI is under the armrest.&nbsp; If you have the RNS315
the aux-in jack is on the headunit.</p>
<p><b>Note 4:</b> The Phatbox was a mp3 player that emulated a cd changer.&nbsp; It's
plug-play if you have a MFD2 but I would much rather have a handheld mp3 player
since the phatbox is a big brick that you have to store under the seat and will
only work in your car.</p>
<p><b>Note 5:</b> The RCD310 was only available outside of the US as a base
radio.&nbsp; In Canada you couldn't get it with the MDI but you could get it as
an option to the RCD310 outside of North America.</p>
<p><b>Note 6:</b> While this cable is only designed to work with the MFD2 aux,
if the radio has an external sat module you can just depin the sat radio audio
signal plugs and put in the aux pins.&nbsp; More details under &quot;<a href="#auxin">Using
with another radio</a>&quot;.&nbsp; I don't know if the Touareg and RNS 310 have
internal or external sat radio modules.</p>
<p><b>Note 7:</b> The MDI was optional depending on the model and trim.&nbsp;
Most radios that came with a RCD510 came with the MDI.&nbsp; Most TDI had it
standard.&nbsp; The exception is the sportwagen - you could buy these with the
standard RCD510 radio but without the MDI.</p>
<h4>If you have the premium 7 radio (in-dash 6
cd changer built in, no touchscreen, equipped 2005.5-2009)</h4>
<p> <b><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/premium7.jpg" alt="vw premiunm 7 radio headunit" width="833" height="252"></b> </p>
<p> <b>The best solution is:</b> VW's ISA cable (ipod satellite adapter), 1k0 051 510 a
(1k0051510a).&nbsp; This adapter only works on premium 7 radios with satellite.&nbsp;
It will charge 12V ipod so if you have a 5V ipod you need the voltage step down
adapter mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Details of operation were at the top of the
page.&nbsp; You can still keep your satellite but you have to unplug your iPod
to listen to sat radio.</p>
<p> DICE sells a number of iPod kits that work like VW's ISA cable.&nbsp; It
charges both 12V and 5V ipods.&nbsp; It displays text info and also includes an
Aux input.&nbsp; It also replaces the sat module.&nbsp; However, some require
removal of any external cd changers.</p>
<p> You can use the mk4 iPod cable w/quadlock connector plug (1k0051444) but I
wouldn't because it just emulates a CD changer.&nbsp; I would get the ISA
cable.&nbsp; Volk-L Bluetooth 1k0 051 437 (1k0051437) or 1k0051437a&nbsp; (1k0
051 437 a) will not work with it.&nbsp; The first 5 CDs will act as the first 5 playlists in
alphabetical order.&nbsp; The 6th
CD will act like all the other playlists.&nbsp; You cannot see the track or artist
information.&nbsp; It will charge 12V iPod so if you have a newer iPod with 5V,
see the note above about the voltage step down adapter.</p>
<p>If you have the ipod dock under the center armrest 1k0 857 825 e
(1k0857825e), it acts just like the mk4
iPod cable, only it's a dock instead of a cable.&nbsp; You can have either aux
or ipod dock but not both since they use the same spot.&nbsp; You can add it
later but it requires you to swap the armrest to one that can fit a cd changer/ipod
dock/MDI dock.&nbsp; See <a href="../a5/install-ipod-2006-jetta-tdi.htm">1000q:
ipod dock installation</a> for details.</p>
<p>You cannot use the VW MDI.</p>
<p>You cannot use the Phatbox.</p>
<p>Some late 2006 came with female aux-in (require a male-male plug to use with
iPod) in the glovebox or under the dashboard console area.&nbsp; They originally
came with a
promotional guitar that plugged into this port.</p>
<p><b>If you have a 2005.5-2006, </b>I would get the ISA cable.&nbsp; It's
pretty good because it displays artist, playlist, etc. on the radio.&nbsp; The
radio has black buttons and is shown above left.&nbsp; You cannot splice into any aux-input, if
equipped.&nbsp; The head unit cannot play mp3 CD.</p>
<p><b>If you have a 2007-2009</b>, you can use VW's cd emulator ipod cable <i>or</i>
the factory CD changer <i>or</i> an aux-in.&nbsp; You cannot more than one of
these because they occupy the same slot.&nbsp; The radio has silver
buttons.&nbsp; A better solution is to use VW's ISA ipod kit.&nbsp; There's an
mp3 label above the CD slot - this means the cd player can play mp3 CDs.</p>
<p>VW also removed the CD changer detect logic from the radio.&nbsp; This means
that you can splice or remove the existing iPod adapter wiring to add your own
3.5mm aux-in.</p>
<h4>If you have the MFD2 OEM GPS system (color screen, not touchscreen, optional
2005.5-2009, for touareg see below)</h4>
<p><b>The best solution is:</b> an aux-in with either a male 3.5mm jack (like a
headphone cable) or iPod male plug.&nbsp; The other end only
works for the navigation radio because the 18 pin connector is unique to nav
radios.&nbsp;
The OEM 3.5mm cable is VW# 000-051-444-m (000051444m).&nbsp; It's pretty cheap so
this is a good option.&nbsp; You can also find generic 3.5mm aux-in cables on ebay
that are cheaper than the OEM part.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have an iPod I suggest
getting a generic aux-in cable with an iPod end.&nbsp; These won't have any more function than the 3.5mm aux-in but
they give a clearer signal and you don't have to turn the volume on the iPod all
the way up.&nbsp; This lets
you keep the armrest CD changer.</p>
<p>Because it's basically a headphone outlet, the iPod is not locked while it's
plugged in.</p>
<p><a name="auxin"><b>To use this aux in with any other radio,</b> </a>you must
first figure out if the radio has an internal or external satellite radio
module.&nbsp; If it has an external module you can depin and replace the sat
radio plug's left, right, and ground wires with the aux in pins.&nbsp; Don't
remove the other pins.&nbsp; Most of the radios have CD changer detect logic
which prevents you from using aux-in with the cd-changer plug without the detect
logic handshake.&nbsp; I believe the later radios removed this but I'm not 100%
sure.</p>
<p>To use the aux-in, from the CD screen, there's
a contextual button to go to Aux.&nbsp; See more in <a href="../a5/mfd2-GPS-FAQ-VW.htm">1000q:
MFD2 VW GPS FAQ</a> or if you have a European unit.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/nav/mfd1.jpg" alt="vw mfd2 gps cd changer aux" width="810" height="378"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/mfd2-aux-in.jpg" align="right" width="299" height="165">If you already have the aux-in cable and are swapping in the MFD2, someone
named Jetturbo found that you just need to swap the plug end to make the cable
work.&nbsp; The
18 pin aux plug is VW# 7m0-035-727 (7m0035727).&nbsp; Just depin the old
connector and repin it into the new plug.&nbsp; If you buy the whole male 3.5mm
aux cable it includes instructions but here they are if you just buy the plug:
the black wire goes in slot 2.&nbsp; The white wire goes in slot 11.&nbsp; The
red wire goes in slot 12.&nbsp; The stock photo which sellers typically use is
shown right.</p>
<p>While there are aftermarket solutions ipod adapters that take the spot of the
Aux plug, they cost around $200 and don't do anything more over the 3.5mm aux-in
other than charge the battery.</p>
<p>You cannot use VW's ISA ipod cable for the premium 7 radio.</p>
<p>You cannot use the VW MDI.</p>
<p>You can use Phatbox with the MFD2 - it plugs right into the CD changer
cable.&nbsp; You must remove the CD player to use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use VW's mk4 ipod cable but it just emulates the cd changer so you
would have to remove the CD changer.&nbsp;
Read the section above for more description of function.</p>
<p>You can remove the cd changer in the armrest and put in VW's ipod dock 1k0
857 825 e (1k0857825e).&nbsp; It's just the mk4 ipod cable in dock
form.&nbsp; In either case, you must remove the OEM
6 cd changer in the armrest.&nbsp; See <a href="../a5/install-ipod-2006-jetta-tdi.htm">1000q:
ipod dock installation</a> for the detailed installation procedure.&nbsp; If your firmware is at least 47, you can play
audio CD in the single disk slot on the nav.&nbsp; See <a href="../a5/vw-gps-software-update-flash-mfd2.htm">1000q:
MFD2 firmware check</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The MFD2 GPS navigation can have (iPod dock OR mk4 cable OR armrest CD
changer) and aux and
satellite at the same time.</p>

<p>If you had one of these radios you car came with an iPod adapter VW# 000 051 446 c (000051446c) with the MDI in the armrest or glovebox.&nbsp;
The exception was some sportwagen, Canadian base cars w/o multimedia package,
and European cars.&nbsp; In Canada, the base radio was the RCD 310. The
optional multimedia pack added the RCD510 and MDI.&nbsp; Outside of North America, you could also get the
MDI as an option to the RCD310.</p>
<p>If you retrofitted any of these radios to your older mk5 car you can use the VW MDI.</p>
<p>If your car came with any of these radios it should also have a 3.5mm aux-in.</p>
<p>If you want to change the iPod adapter, the part numbers are below for:<br>
-mini USB: 000 051 446 a (000051446a)<br>
-USB adapter: 000 051 446 b (000051446b)<br>
-3.5mm aux-in: 000 051 446 d (000051446d)</p>
<p>
I also see the part numbers below but verify them with your dealer before ordering.<br>
iPod adapter: 5n0 035 554 (5n0035554)<br>
USB adapter: 5n0 035 558 (5n0035558)</p>
<p>If your car didn't have an MDI you can use the iPod adapter cable 1k0 051 444
a (1k0051444a).&nbsp; It cannot be used in conjunction with a CD changer.&nbsp;
It's basically a CD emulator like the mk4 cable except that it works on the
newer touchscreen radios.&nbsp; Unlike the MDI which give full control and info,
this cable only gives basic control and info like track and playlist.&nbsp; I
suggest getting the MDI controller over this.</p>
<p> You cannot use the mk3/mk4 ipod cable w/quadlock connector plug (1k0051444).</p>
<p>Your car came with an iPod adapter with the MDI in the armrest or glovebox.&nbsp;
You should also have an aux-in.</p>
<p>If you retrofitted one of the GPS systems to your older mk5 car, you can only
use VW's MDI interface.</p>
<hr>
<h3>If you have a Touareg and want to add an ipod adapter cable</h3>
<p>The VW ISA kit will not work on any 2004 or newer Touareg.&nbsp; Those are
only for premium 7 radios on Jetta/Golf/Eos/Tiguan.</p>
<p>In my opinion, unless you have the RNS510 GPS or plan to add it, I would go
aftermarket for an ipod adapter.&nbsp; If your car is 2007 or earlier, you will
need a newer CAN BUS module if you add the OEM VW GPS RNS 510.</p>
<h4>If you have a 2004-2008 with MFD2 GPS navigation system</h4>
<p>There are aux-in adapters that will plug into the back of the radio.&nbsp; I
don't believe VW sells any so you have to look to the aftermarket.&nbsp; You
could use the mk4 iPod kit 1k0051444 but see above for the limitations.&nbsp; It
also removes the CD changer and satellite radio.</p>
<p>Also, many Touareg with the Navigation system already have RCA plugs under
the armrest.&nbsp; You just need to get an adapter to a 3.5mm jack.</p>
<p>You can substitute an external CD changer for a Phatbox but see the notes
earlier about limitations.</p>
<h4>If you don't have the MFD2 GPS in your 2004-08 Touareg</h4>
<p>The only kit that will work is 1k0051444, the mk4 VW iPod kit.&nbsp; It is
not compatible with satellite radio or an external CD changer.&nbsp; If you have
the MFD2 you can use the Phatbox.</p>
<h3>If you have a Touareg 2009-2010 and want to add an ipod adapter cable</h3>
<p>If your car came with navigation (the tech package), it already has the
Touareg MDI VW# 5n0 035 342 b (5n0035342b) and ipod adapter VW# 000 051 446 c (000051446c).&nbsp;
(I also see 5n007 342 as an older part number).&nbsp; If you wish to change the
adapter cable, see the part numbers above for Jetta/Golf.</p>
<p>If your car didn't come with the tech package you have to retrofit the RNS510
GPS navigation system to add the MDI and iPod adapter.&nbsp; The MDI will not
work with the base radio.&nbsp; You can use the mk4 CD emulator ipod cable but it removes any external 6cd
changer.&nbsp; Because of the limitations of the emulator cable, I would rather
go aftermarket if you don't have the MDI.</p>
<p>I have also seen the following info for the Touareg but I'm not 100% sure
what it is.&nbsp; VW# 1k0 051 445 is a 550mm long quadlock cable.&nbsp; 000051444k
is an iPod adapter.</p>
