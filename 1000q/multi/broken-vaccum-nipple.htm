<h2>This article shows how to repair a broken plastic vacuum nipple on the exhaust gas recirculation or anti shudder valve.</h2>

<h3>Parts</h3>
<p>Loctite Epoxy Plastic Bonder with 20-minute setting  time</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Many of us have found that by bumping the vacuum hose  attached to the vacuum actuator on the anti-shudder valve, or by simply trying  to remove the hose from the actuator, it is not difficult to break the nipple  right off. And we have also discovered that the actuator is not available  separately form the EGR/anti-shudder valve, that valve having a dealer price of  about $320 or an aftermarket price of about $150-$220. Well, mine broke and I  was not willing to pay for a new EGR valve. So, I developed a procedure to  repair the actuator.</p>
<p>First, I wanted to take a look at the broken-off nipple. I  had to slice the hose lengthwise to get the nipple out. This is the nipple:<br>

<p>I decided to try to attach a new, longer nipple to the  actuator. I found a vacuum connector in my parts bin that is close to the  diameter of the original nipple and cut it off to the length I wanted. I used a  5/64&quot; drill bit to line up the new nipple with the passageway at the  bottom of the &quot;dog house.&quot; I then filled the &quot;dog house&quot;  with an agressive caulk/sealant that I had on hand.<br>

<p>Well, the caulk didn't cure overnight so I decided to try  something different.</p>
<p>I concluded that attaching a new nipple securely to the  actuator is a more robust method. I CAREFULLY trimmed away the dog house until  only a short nipple remained. I also used a hobby knife to scratch the surface  of the actuator around the nipple, to aid in adhesion.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/a4/broken-vac-3.jpg" width="549" height="500"><br>
  I looked in my collection and found a vacuum adapter that  had one end that could be made to fit over the nipple and the other end that  was the correct size for the vacuum hose. I trimmed it to length and bored out  the large end to fit over the nipple on the actuator. I also roughed up the  outside of the adapter to aid in adhesion.</p>
<p><img src="../../images/a4/broken-vac-4.jpg" alt="" width="669" height="500"></p>
<p>Using Loctite Epoxy Plastic Bonder with 20-minute setting  time (the only readily-available plastic adhesive made for use with nylon that  I could find--beware, there is, apparently, another Loctite plastic epoxy that  has a 5-minute setting time that does not mention being compatible with nylon),  I glued the modified adapter to the nipple on the actuator.<br>

</p>
<p>Please note that I built the epoxy up around the base of the  adapter in order to provide additional lateral support for the adapter (maybe  it's overkill, maybe not). After the epoxy cured overnight, I found that the  passageway was clogged. I CAREFULLY ran a small drill bit into the passageway at  slow speed to clear the clog (do not run the drill bit too deep or you will  ruin the actuator bladder). After drilling, I held the actuator with the nipple  facing down and quickly pushed the actuator arm to expel any bits that may have  fallen into the actuator can.</p>
<p>Here's the result--a vacuum actuator that holds vacuum and  fits well in the engine compartment (note that I made the new hose a bit longer  than might otherwise be needed in order to kink it around the EGR cooler hose).<br>

<p>And the car operates correctly! All for less than $10.</p>
<p>Since I just completed the repair this morning, I do not  have an idea about the longevity of the repair (the long-term adhesion of the  epoxy). I will update this thread should I experience any problems.</p>
<p>An afterthought: My original repair idea might have been  more successful had I had the plastic epoxy on hand and used it in place of the  caulk/sealer. But the integrity of the vacuum passage would not have been as  sure as it is with my second method.</p>
