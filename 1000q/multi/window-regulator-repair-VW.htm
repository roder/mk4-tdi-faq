<h2>The window regulating clips are known for failure on the VW mk4 cars&nbsp; (Passat, Jetta, Golf, also applies to mk5
Jetta/Golf/Rabbit).&nbsp; This shows how to fix a window that fell down.</h2>
<p>VW used large plastic sliders and a 2 piece clip which was redesigned as a small
plastic slider and 1 piece clip.&nbsp; This article applies to all 1999.5-2004
VW, both gasoline and diesel.&nbsp; It also applies to all VW Passat up to 2005
and some mk5 Jetta/Golf.&nbsp;
If you are hearing a clunk when the power windows move up and down, it may be
the window regulator clips failing.&nbsp; Grinding or clicking noises indicate
that the clip may fail soon.&nbsp; Once the clip fails, the window glass often falls into the
door and cannot be raised, leaving the window open.</p>
<p>At least on the Jetta, VW extended the warranty on the window regulators to 7 years from the original
date of purchase, for 2001-2002 models, see below for the letter.&nbsp; If you
explain the problem to the dealership they know exactly what the problem is
because it's a common problem.</p>
<p>Try to raise the window to help secure the window before shutting the door.&nbsp;
Some think that this helps.</p>
<p>The Jetta started getting the new clips sometime in 2003.&nbsp; The Passat
got the old clips all the way to the end of B5.5 model run in 2005.&nbsp; Even
after they switched to the 1 piece metal clip, instead of a clip breaking, the clip slips off.&nbsp;
If you remove the door panel it's suggested to glue the clips in place.&nbsp;
Your car is not unique, the mk3 window regulators fail often too.&nbsp; They
finally fixed it sometime in the mk5 generation.</p>

      and New Beetle.&nbsp; You can also click here: <a href="../../images/pdf/windowregtsb.pdf">window

<p>Remove the door panels for the side you want to fix.&nbsp; If you have a mk4 Jetta or Golf see <a href="../a4/door-card-removal.htm">1000q: how to remove the door
panels on Jetta.</a>&nbsp; If you have a mk4 VW Passat, see <a href="../b5/doorcardB5remove.htm"> 1000q: how to remove the
door panels on mk4 B5 B5.5 Passat</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a mk5 Jetta or
Golf (Rabbit), see <a href="../a5/door-skin-jetta-remove.htm">1000q: mk5 outer
door skin removal</a> and <a href="../a5/door-card-jetta-removal.htm">1000q: mk5
door card removal</a>.</p>
<h4>Front doors
</h4>
<p>After you remove the door panels, disconnect the wires for the speakers, power window motor,
and power side view mirror.&nbsp; Basically, you have to remove all the
wiring.&nbsp; Remove the speakers if they can
come off.&nbsp; Remove all the 10mm bolts holding on the inner door skin.&nbsp;
Release the door latch and door plunger seals. (yellow arrows)<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm1.jpg" width="846" height="607">
</p>
<p>Also punch out the center of the 2
plastic rivets holding the door lock module (the 2 closely spaced yellow arrows
above and below, panel already removed for illustration).&nbsp; See <a href="Door-Module-Removal-Jetta-Passat-Golf.htm">1000q:
how to remove the door lock module</a> for more details and pics.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/body/doorm2.jpg" width="810" height="664"></p>
<p>If the window still works you have to separate the window from it's rail.&nbsp;
Open the rubber caps for the access holes (opened in the picture below) and look
through them.&nbsp; Raise/lower the power window until you see the 10mm bolt
(white arrow below) that holds the regulator clip (1x 10mm bolt per clip).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg1.jpg" width="900" height="675">
</p>
<p>If the window is working then manually raise the window glass while moving
the regulator down.&nbsp; If the window motors are not working then securely support the window with tape
before removing these bolts!&nbsp; If the window falls down it can break or
injure you!&nbsp; Raise/lower the power window and the clip will come off.
</p>
<p>If the window does not work, manually move the window to get the 10mm bolts
into view by removing the window motor (if there are screws) or removing the 4x torx screws
holding the window regulator motor cover.&nbsp; Pull the motor out just enough so that the
gears can move.&nbsp; Then you can push the window down manually.&nbsp; <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg5.jpg" width="720" height="540">
</p>
<p>If you happen to pull the motor out past the brushes (white arrow below, the
stationary spring loaded part that contacts the motor shaft), just move the
brushes back when you push the motor back into place.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg6.jpg" width="450" height="391">
</p>
<p>If the window is
broken it should move anyways.&nbsp; Once the clips are disconnected unplug
the power window motor and remove it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The door and window should both be loose.&nbsp; Reach behind the inner door
skin and remove any remaining wiring or connections from the sheetmetal door
panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the Jetta and Golf, the window track extends above the top of the sheetmetal
panel of the door.&nbsp; In the Passat, the window track extends below the
bottom of the door.&nbsp; When removing the inner door skin, you have to slide
the free side (either upper or lower) out first.&nbsp; Take care to make sure
the window doesn't suddenly drop down.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg2.jpg" width="720" height="511"></p>
<p>If you want to remove the window glass, just pull it out.&nbsp; Of note: this
window has aftermarket tinted glass film.&nbsp; You can see where the film
ends.&nbsp; The 2 lower parts are where the window clips attach.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg4.jpg" width="720" height="445"></p>
<p>Flip the sheetmetal door panel over.&nbsp; The window sliders (green arrow)
is what breaks.&nbsp;There are 2 piece metal clips on them that hold the window.&nbsp;
Unhook the old plastic/metal clips and replace with the new one.&nbsp; Glue the
new 1 piece regulator clips to the sliders and window.&nbsp; Only replace the cables if
they are damaged.&nbsp; Pictured below is the Jetta window regulator with metal
clips removed.&nbsp; The Jetta window regulator rails stick out above the door
panel.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg6a.jpg" width="822" height="542"></p>
<p>Pictured below is the Passat window regulator with the metal clips still
attached.&nbsp; The Passat window rails stick out below the door panel.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg3.jpg" width="810" height="546"></p>
<p>You can now remove the window regulator motor, just screw the 3x torx bolts
holding it to the door skin.&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Rear windows </h4>
<p>Remove the door cards as linked above.&nbsp; Also remove the wiring and the
10mm bolts around the edge of the door.&nbsp; Punch out the center of the door
module plastic rivets. </p>
<p>Open the rubber access panel and lower the window until you see the dowel pin
holding the window glass to the clip.&nbsp; Push it out.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg7.jpg" width="720" height="653"> </p>
<p>Here you can see where the dowel pin goes - near the bottom of the window
travel.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg9.jpg" width="720" height="596"> </p>
<p>Here is a picture of the pin in the window glassfor illustration.&nbsp;
Normally the pin locks the clip to the window glass. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/windowreg8.jpg" width="720" height="540"> </p>
<p>The Jetta is similar, see the below picture.&nbsp; The door bolts are circled
in green below.<br>
