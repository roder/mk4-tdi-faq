<p>Polishing the paint means to smooth the surface of the paint by polishing
away material.&nbsp; Polished paint will appear
clearer and more vibrant.&nbsp; Reflections will appear sharper and &quot;spiderwebs&quot;
will be reduced.&nbsp; Waxing hides imperfections in the paint by covering them
over to create a smooth surface, polishing removes them and lets the wax do a
better job to let the paint pop.&nbsp;
This can also repair stains that have etched into the paint like bird poop or vandalism.&nbsp;
Polishing does remove a
very, very thin layer of clearcoat or paint, so how often you polish is ultimately up to your preferences.&nbsp;
I suggest once or twice a year.&nbsp; For polishing plastic or headlights to
clear up cloudy lenses, see <a href="how-to-polish-foggy-headlight-lenses-kit-review.htm">1000q:
polish headlights</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Can your auto paint benefit from polishing?&nbsp; Here's how to test and polish
out swirl marks.</h3>
<p>Here's a quick test to see if your car could benefit from polishing.&nbsp;
Take a bright light and look around the
reflection.&nbsp; The reflection of the sun also works.&nbsp; Do you see lots of circular &quot;spiderwebs&quot; or swirled scratches?&nbsp;
These can be
polished out.&nbsp; If you can feel the scratches you need stronger
treatment or a series of polishes over time to reduce them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swirl marks or spiderwebs are caused by dirty washing materials, dirty tools,
and automatic car washes (I only use the brushless washes).&nbsp; Below are some
pictures of spiderwebbing (click to enlarge)<br>
<a href="../../images/misc/detailing/spiderweb1.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/tn/spiderweb1-tn.jpg" width="269" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/misc/detailing/spiderweb2.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img src="../../images/misc/detailing/tn/spiderweb2-tn.jpg" alt="" width="273" height="200" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Where do spider webs come from?&nbsp; Harsh cleaning materials or towels,
  improper cleaning, or normal wear and tear create tiny scratches.&nbsp; I have
  never seen a used car that couldn't benefit from polishing unless that car was just
polished!</p>
<h4>Polish and rubbing compound</h4>
<p>Using a polish on the paint should be the extent of removing material from
the paint under normal conditions&nbsp; Only if there is a noticeable scratch or
severe dulling should you try using a light rubbing compound such as 3m finesse
it over a larger area such as a panel.&nbsp; I have also tried Meguiars Step 1
scratch remover and find it to be similar to the 3m finesse it rubbing compound
in strength.&nbsp; Turtle Wax's <u>premium</u> rubbing compound, (<b>NOT</b> the
red colored paste in a can, that is way too strong, it's in a green plastic tube
and is light green in color) is a little stronger than the 3m and Meguiars
product and would be good for a first polish if your paint has some scratches
and imperfections.&nbsp; If you have a scratch, isolate the
use of rubbing compound to the affected area only.&nbsp; Polish is
often called swirl mark remover but each brand and even combinations with
different pads will produce different results.&nbsp; Even some paints tend to be
softer than others.&nbsp; The turtle wax regular
polish in a can is not very good for machine use
because it is formulated for hand use and is only slightly
lighter than their premium rubbing compound.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's decent for spot use
on scratches.&nbsp; You should <i>never</i> put a hard
rubbing compound such as turtle wax regular rubbing compound (the red stuff in a
can) to an entire panel since it
is best
for spot use by hand only!&nbsp; Here is a list summarizing my guesses of
strength, starting from lightest to harshest, please note that this changes
according to what pad you are using and is my subjective guess.&nbsp; There are
also many other brands that I have not tested, this list is my opinion only.</p>
<p><b>Lightest</b><br>

Harshest&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/sup.jpg" width="619" height="338"></p>
<p>I suggest a very light machine oriented rubbing compound for the first ever
detailing if your paint has some imperfections.&nbsp; The turtle wax <u>premium</u>
rubbing compound or 3m rubbing compound works well for a more dull finish the
first ever application.&nbsp; Remember, t he
premium turtle compound is in a tube, the regular is in a can, is red in color, and is
way to harsh.&nbsp; After that, use light rubbing compound on spot scratches and
then a full car light polish once or twice a year.&nbsp; Heavier rubbing
compound is not appropriate and the more material you remove, the less you have to work with
later.&nbsp; To put it into perspective, the entire thickness of the paint may only about
5/1000 of an inch think.&nbsp; It is better to polish less over a series of
applications rather than
more aggressively in one application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use too hard foam or too hard compound, you will end up with
holograms.&nbsp; These are spider marks that appear in one direction.&nbsp; You
can't see them in dark light but in direct sunlight from the right angle or
under certain lighting, it looks like streaking on top of the paint.&nbsp; If
you get these, follow up with a softer polish and foam pad.&nbsp; To avoid
these, do not polish until the compound is dry, it should always stay
moist.&nbsp; More on technique below.</p>
<h4>The porter cable polisher and other tools</h4>
<p>If you want good results, I would also recommend using a porter cable random
orbit polisher and a spot treatment polisher.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's also sold under
the Meguiar's name and as the ultimate detailing machine.</p>
<p> The
advantage of a porter cable polisher is that it is suitable for use by beginners
and advanced users.&nbsp; It makes it very unlikely to damage the paint unless
you are being extremely aggressive and misusing the tool.&nbsp; Unless you are
polishing only a small spot, I do not recommend polishing by hand unless you
don't mind tennis elbow.&nbsp; Polishing an entire car by hand would take all
day, which is not my idea of fun if there is a faster and easier way.</p>
<p>Note that the porter cable random orbit polisher is probably the best tool
out there for home use.&nbsp; It's reasonably priced, works very well, and is
compact enough to get into tight spaces.&nbsp; Unlike the cheapo 10&quot; large
random orbit polisher you can find at discount stores, the porter cable has a
large, dual axis orbit and a free floating head.&nbsp; The 10&quot; orbital polishers do
not have a very good motion and you will find that they are not very effective
at anything other than removing wax.&nbsp; The porter cable is also not a rotary
buffer.&nbsp; Rotary buffers rotate on a single axis and are much more likely to
damage your paint due to uneven polishing.&nbsp; The reason power drill or a
sander attachments don't work well is because they're too fast.&nbsp; The
ideal rpm is around 1000-5000 rpm and going too fast will dry out
the compounds and cause uneven results.</p>
<p>A good spot treatment polisher is the mother's powerball for paint.&nbsp; If
you only have a powerball mini, that will work for spot treatment.&nbsp; It is a
foam ball that you attach it to a drill.&nbsp; It's the right size for polishing
out the scratches under the door handles and for the lights.&nbsp; The powerball
for paint is a softer foam and is the correct tool for paint, the powerball mini
is a hard foam and you should use it with softer polishes to avoid
holograms.</p>
<p>Below is a porter
cable polisher.&nbsp; I didn't put the microfiber towel on the ground - you don't want it to pick up dirt!&nbsp; Also
below are some of the compounds that I like to use.&nbsp; If you skipped the
section above, the turtle wax can products are for spot use by hand only because
they tend to be too rough for machine use.</p>
<p>Below: a porter cable random orbital polisher, 1 wash bucket, 1 chenille sponge, 2
polishing pads, and 1 microfiber cloth.&nbsp; I also suggest a few more cloths
and 1 rinse bucket.<br>

<h3>How to polish the car's paint to remove spiderwebs or swirl marks</h3>
<p>
First wash and dry the car.&nbsp; As simple as it seems, there are tricks to
properly washing your car.&nbsp; See <a href="washwax.htm">1000q:
wash and wax your car</a> for more details.&nbsp; If the car is dirty, you will only rub
contaminants into the paint and damage your polisher pads and paint.&nbsp; Tape
over rubber trim or anything else you don't want stained white.&nbsp; Black
rubberized trim or the black trim around the sunroof tends to become stained
white if you don't tape over them.</p>
<p>Working on a section at a time, apply
polishing compound to the polishing pad and spread it over the dry (or nearly
dry) car to
prevent
splatter once you turn the polisher on.&nbsp; You want to use enough compound to
cover that section with a light coat, not enough to be flinged around when you turn on the buffer.&nbsp;
Remember that the car should be freshly washed and dry, a few water drops are
fine.&nbsp; If there is a lot of water, be
prepared to have a lot of polish get flinged around and to waste a lot of
product.&nbsp; Always use more polish rather than less.&nbsp; Not enough polish causes the
applied polish to dry out and causes excess wear on the pad.&nbsp; Once the
polish dries out, it is no longer effective and can cause holograms.&nbsp; Over time,
you will learn how much polish is appropriate.&nbsp; The amount of polish
pictured below was enough for the both doors and a little bit on the roof.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/286.jpg" width="545" height="458"></p>
<p>If you have some scratches, use a powerball mini or powerball for paint for
spot treatment before doing the whole car.</p>
<p>If you just washed the car, the ground will also be
wet.&nbsp; The extension cord that you are using is on the ground and
covered with dirt particles.&nbsp; Make sure to avoid letting that dirty cord
touch the paint, or else you will cause lots of scratches when you try to polish
the paint!&nbsp; The dirt may also get caught on the polishing pad and cause
more scratches.&nbsp; I suggest putting the cord over your shoulder.&nbsp; Your
clothes will get some splatter on them, so wear work clothes that you won't mind
getting dirty.</p>
<p>
I suggest moving in a back and forth overlapping pattern which will cover the
entire section evenly.&nbsp; You did smear the compound around, right? Otherwise
it will get wasted when it gets flinged all over you and onto the ground.&nbsp; Try left-right, then diagonally one way, then the
next.&nbsp; There is no need to press down on the polisher as
only very light pressure is needed to let the pad do its job.&nbsp; If the pad
stops rotating, you are either pressing too hard or need to add more speed.&nbsp;
The speed adjustment goes from 1 to 6.&nbsp; I find that 5 is the maximum that
you really need to use.&nbsp; 6 will cause excess vibrations, make it harder to
control the tool, and build excessive heat.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find that the
compound is drying out too fast, add more compound if the problem is
insufficient compound or spritz a few drops of water on the paint to keep it
wet.&nbsp; The picture below is the initial application, polish until the
compound starts to dry to a haze.&nbsp; You don't want it to dry to the point
where it is flaking off.</p>
<p>When turning the polisher on or off, I suggest holding it gently on the
surface of the paint.&nbsp; This
prevents an over speed of the pad.&nbsp; It's less stressful on the bearings and
helps prevent compound that's already on the pad from getting flinged
off from no resistance and high speed.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/287.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>
For the corners or under the door handle, use the powerball mini and follow up
with a polish.&nbsp; The powerball mini is a hard foam and is best for spot
use.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be careful not to pause on ridges or corners as this will cause more material to be removed
from those spots.&nbsp; Many cars have ridges or raised areas on the hood.&nbsp;
Because they are raised, the polishing pad will apply
more action to these areas and remove material much faster than from flat areas.&nbsp;
If you plan on having your car looking its best, it will need occasional
polishing. It won't go through the paint as long as you are very mild, but
remember that the ridges and high spots will prevent the low spots from getting
polished.&nbsp; More aggressive pads and compounds can go through the paint if
there's a very sharp crease or raised area and you sit on it for a while.&nbsp;
The newest BMW and other cars have sharp creases in the sheetmetal, so avoid
polishing the raised folds at all.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're done, wipe off the polish with a microfiber towel and wax the car
the scratch - free way, as seen in the
article: <a href="washwax.htm">1000 answered
questions: washing and waxing your car</a>.</p>
<p><b>Final polishing note</b></p>
<p>Don't try to take a scratched up car and try to make it 100% perfect
the first time polishing.&nbsp; If there are light scratches, you may just have
to be happy making it less noticeable for now.&nbsp; When it's time to polish
the car again, you can give those scratches some spot treatment and polish the
car again.&nbsp; Do less now otherwise there won't be anything left to polish
away later!&nbsp; If it's not noticeable from a few feet away, I would leave it
alone for now.</p>
<p>After you have used the pad, put it into a bucket of clean, soapy
water.&nbsp; Let it soak for a while, then wash and rise clean.&nbsp; Let it dry
completely before you use it again.&nbsp; Don't try to machine wash the pads or
else they can be damaged!&nbsp; With proper care, the pads will last a long
time, so get good pads and take care of them.</p>

<h3>Using rubbing compound to restore more severe paint</h3>
<p>If you have serious scratches or marring of the paint, you have to determine
if rubbing compound is more appropriate.&nbsp; For most people, a light rubbing
compound designed for machine use would be appropriate for a first polish.&nbsp;
Never use harsh rubbing compound because it is not designed for machine use and
will probably dull your paint!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If
you still have questions on whether or not your brand of rubbing compound is appropriate, the answer is NO!&nbsp;
It's always best to be conservative when removing material.&nbsp; Using more
polishing compound for a longer period of time is a better than using less rubbing compound for a shorter period of
time. Rubbing compound could be slightly or much more aggressive than
polishing compound depending on the brand or formula and will remove material more quickly.&nbsp; And since you
follow rubbing compound with polishing compound, it's another reason to be
conservative.&nbsp; If in doubt, always start with the least aggressive compound
first, then determine if more polishing or rubbing is needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would
suggest using a Meguiars step 1 or Turtle Wax premium rubbing compound with the
powerball mini for spot treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Testing scratch depth</h4>
<p>First, determine the severity of the scratch and see if rubbing compound is
appropriate.&nbsp; If you drag a fingernail over the scratch and you don't feel
the edges, take a step back and try to polish out the scratch first . If you
drag a fingernail over the scratch and your fingernail gets caught by the
scratch, the appearance of the scratch can reduced by rubbing compound but not
eliminated.&nbsp; If you see that the scratch goes through the paint into the
primer or metal, you must have the scratch repainted or touched up.&nbsp;
Remember that your goal may not be to erase the scratch completely as it may not
be possible, first try to reduce the appearance of the scratch, then decide from
there if it's worth it to remove more material.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you determine that the scratch can be reduced with rubbing compound but
doesn't need touch up paint, wash and dry your car first.&nbsp; Because rubbing
compound is more appropriate for spot application, I recommend using a clean
towel to apply the rubbing compound and to rub the area.&nbsp; If there is an
improvement in the scratch, try rubbing the scratch some more and seeing if
there is more improvement.&nbsp; If there is no more improvement, you have
already rubbed off all the edges and should now clean and
polish the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best way to treat small scratches is with a powerball mini and light
rubbing compound designed for machine use.&nbsp; This will fix or reduce the
appearance of 95% of scratches.&nbsp; It might not end up perfect but it'll be
close enough and not noticeable.&nbsp; This is the easiest and most cost
effective solution.</p>
<p>If you determine that the scratch is too deep to be rubbed out, you can try
touching up the scratch with paint.&nbsp; Personally, I would rather live with a
not noticeable scratch than a large area with a botched touch up job, so be
conservative whenever possible.&nbsp; First, sand the scratch with light grit
sandpaper, 1500-2000 grit should be enough.&nbsp; You do not want to sand the
area around the scratch, so I suggest taping off the paint around the scratch.&nbsp;
Wipe the area clean with rubbing alcohol to clean the scratch of dust.&nbsp;
Then, using a pin, apply touch up paint to the center of the scratch.&nbsp;
Never use the paintbrush that comes in the bottle because it will leave a big
blob.&nbsp; The paint will move into the scratch through capillary action and
fill it in.&nbsp; Overfill the scratch slightly.&nbsp; Once it dries for at
least 24 hours, sand the scratch flat and polish or use rubbing compound as
necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a similar technique as in <a href="paint-chip-repair.htm">1000q:
paint chip repair</a>.&nbsp; The difference is that a scratch is narrow and can
polished out most of the time.&nbsp; A chip is too wide and large and
cannot.&nbsp; Black, silver, and metallic seem to be the most difficult
colors to touch up, so if you want a perfect repair, I would suggest taking it
to a body shop and seeing what their opinion is.&nbsp; Normally, their opinion
is to do the most expensive repair that is worth their time.</p>
<h4>Polishing paint before and after results</h4>
<p>Here are some before and after pictures with flash and without flash.&nbsp;
They are all from the same angle and with and without flash so that you can see
that this is not a camera trick.&nbsp; I
took the pictures under a fluorescent light because fluorescent lights let you
see all the scratches.&nbsp; These scratches are from improper car washing and an automated car wash
that uses brushes instead of a &quot;no touch&quot; car wash.&nbsp; It received a clay bar treatment and then polish.&nbsp; This
didn't produce satisfactory results so it received light rubbing compound for
machine polishers, then
polishing again.&nbsp; It wasn't perfect but it was a huge improvement.</p>

a huge improvement. (click to enlarge)<br>
