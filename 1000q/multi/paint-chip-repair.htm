<h2>Your car will get chips in normal driving.&nbsp; This article shows how to
repair minor chips yourself.</h2>
<p>Repair the chips as soon as
practical to prevent rust or further damage.&nbsp; This article shows one way of fixing chips.&nbsp; Many people don't like car bras because they give cars an 80's
look.&nbsp; Clear adhesive
paint protection films are currently the best passive protection against chips.&nbsp;
Although
there may be pre-cut film kits for your car, professional installation is highly
recommended.&nbsp; Much like window tint, it's very easy to mess up applying
the film and it will just waste your time and money.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that
most clear adhesive paint protection films are perfectly safe for factory paint
but should not be applied over a repainted area.&nbsp; You can
actively decrease chips by increasing following distances, especially when you
are in construction zones or other areas where debris is on the road.&nbsp; If
you have a mk4 TDI and noticed flaking paint on the fender wheel wells, see <a href="../a4/fender-rust-VW-TDI-repair.htm">1000q:
fender rust TSB</a>.</p>
<p>The main difference between a chip and scratch is the width.&nbsp; If it's a
scratch, I suggest using a paint pen and then polishing it out.&nbsp; See <a href="how-to-polish-paint-porter-cable.htm"> 1000q:
polishing paint</a> for more details.&nbsp; Don't bother using the brush because
it'll just leave a wide splat of paint.&nbsp; If the chip is wide and is too
noticeable or is through the primer, you should repair it and fill it in.</p>
<p>You could take it to a body shop but I don't suggest this unless you want the
car to be perfect or have many chips on 1 panel.&nbsp; It's not cost effective to take it to a pro for 1 small chip, a shop can make more money by
doing a large area, and if they are professionals, this is honestly the best way to get a
professional looking repair.&nbsp; Your results may vary!&nbsp; It's extremely difficult to spray a small
spot on the hood and have it blend into the rest of the panel.&nbsp; As the
repair fades due to sun exposure and age, it will also look different from the
rest of the panel.&nbsp; Good repairs blend the paint up to the edge of the
panel (ie., the hood-fender gap) or fade into curves.</p>
<p>Lastly, some colors are harder to blend than others.&nbsp; Flat red, black,
or blue are easier colors and a repair should not be noticeable.&nbsp; You don't
even need to use a clearcoat on top of a small repair, just polish it.&nbsp;
Metallics and pearls are harder colors to match and a clear coat sometimes helps
with silver metallic.&nbsp; Pearl white is a very hard color to perfectly match.</p>

<h3>Paint chip repair procedure</h3>
<p>First thoroughly clean and dry the affected area.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Use 800 grit sandpaper to clean away loose paint chips at the edges and
smooth down the area.&nbsp; Make sure you use wet/dry automotive sandpaper and
use plenty of water to keep the sandpaper from &quot;loading&quot; up.&nbsp;
Many people like to use a pencil eraser to limit the area of sanding, I just use
my finger or something else if it's too small.&nbsp; You just want to remove any
loose paint chips and rough up the area to ensure paint adhesion.&nbsp; If the chip only goes down to the
primer, try to avoid sanding through the primer.&nbsp; If you can see rust it
means that it is exposed down to the metal so sand all the rust away
first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's best to try to get the edges of the chip as sharp as possible to hold
the paint and get a clean edge as seen below.&nbsp; The 3 basic steps are illustrated below in a side view.&nbsp; The gray
represents the lower layers of primer or metal, the green is the top coat of
paint or clear.&nbsp; The blue is
the touch up paint.&nbsp; If the edges are too smooth, it will be harder to sand
the edges.&nbsp; You want the edges to be defined so the repair sticks and a
defined edge helps to hold the paint within the boundaries of the chip.&nbsp; The idea is to build up the paint and then sand it flat.<br>

<p>Step 1 - sand and loosen any paint chips.&nbsp; I sanded a bit much here
because there was a scratch next to it anyways.&nbsp; I recommend using only
1500 grit maximum here, start with 2000 grit if you're not sure.&nbsp; The edges needed to be cleaned up a little here too.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/chip1.jpg" width="874" height="333"></p>
<p>Use rubbing alcohol to wipe the area clean.&nbsp; You must remove all wax
and grease or else the paint will not stick properly! </p>
<p>If the paint is below 60<sup>o</sup>F, use a heat gun to warm the area.&nbsp;
You want the paint to flow into the chip properly.&nbsp; The touch up paint
should also be fresh.&nbsp; Old paint loses thinner and doesn't flow properly.</p>
<p>Dap the touch up paint onto a paintbrush/wire for small areas and
scratches.&nbsp; I like to
bend the tip into a &quot;V&quot; or loop to hold the paint.&nbsp; A larger loop can hold
more paint.&nbsp; That huge sloppy paintbrush in the bottle
cap is ok if you have a large area to paint like the chip shown.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/paintwire.JPG" width="206" height="58"><br>
You want the paint to fill in the chip, little by little by capillary action for
small chips.&nbsp; For large chips you want to keep the paint within the edges
of the chip.&nbsp; You can use a heat gun to help the paint flash and dry to apply
the next layer.&nbsp; The idea is to build up the chip with more paint than is
necessary and sand it flat later.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the paint will shrink
as it dries, so apply plenty of paint.&nbsp; If it's too cold, the paint won't
flow properly to fill in the gaps.&nbsp; A sharp boundary will help hold the paint, which
is another reason why you want to remove any loose chips and clean the area
well.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/chip2.jpg" width="935" height="363"></p>
<p>If it is a really large chip, you may have to apply a few coats over a couple of
days to let it dry properly.&nbsp; Many thin coats are better than a few thick
coats.&nbsp; If a small chip, let the paint dry for
at least 24 hours and sand it flat with the sanding
block and 1000-800 grit wet/dry.&nbsp; Always use plenty of water during sanding to make sure there is no
dirt that could cause scratches.&nbsp; If you skip using a sanding
block, the area will not be flat and it will be more noticeable.&nbsp; The
repair will appear wavy if try to use your finger as a sanding block so don't skip
buying the correct supplies!&nbsp; Avoid
sanding the edges and corners too much because you might sand through the new
paint or the transition between the touch up and original paint.&nbsp; The
corners can be polished out later.</p>
<p>If there are any low spots or &quot;bubbles and fisheyes&quot;, you have to fill them in with more paint
now because
they will be much more noticeable later.&nbsp; If not, then you are ready to do
the final sanding with 1500/2000 grit sandpaper.&nbsp; If you do see bubbles or
fisheyes, this is normally due to wax, grease, or water contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, use rubbing compound to finish the area and then polish.&nbsp; Give it a
final wash and then wax. </p>

<p>Here is an extreme close up of the final result.&nbsp; It's most visible at certain
angles but from 5 feet away you can't tell that it's there.&nbsp; It's not
perfect, but it's still a huge improvement over the rusty chip and this will
prevent any further rust. </p>
