<h1>How to do a compression test on a VW TDI or Audi TDI engine</h1>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows how to do a compression test on a VW TDI engine or Audi
TDI engine.</h2>
<p>A compression test will tell you the compression of the engine.&nbsp; It is
not to be confused with a leakdown test, which puts air into the cylinders and
measures the rate that the air leaks out.&nbsp; A leakdown test is another test
to determine the condition of the engine.&nbsp; It's also not a <a href="boost-leak-tester-DIY-check.htm">boost
leak test</a> which tests for air leaks upstream of the engine.</p>

<p>VW compression for all 1.9L diesel non pumpe duse (ALH AHU,1Z) and pumpe duse
engines (BEW)<br>
New: 363-450 psi<br>
Minimum limit: 276 psi<br>
Max difference between cylinders: 73 psi</p>

<p>Note - it's normal to get readings of up to 500-550 psi on a TDI engine, this
is considered normal.&nbsp; The specs above are on a new engine, after the
engine is broken in you may see higher compression.&nbsp; Keep in mind that high
altitude will  lower compression test readings.</p>

<p>Excessively low engine compression can be piston/cylinder wear, bad valve,
bad head gasket, or a cracked engine.&nbsp; Diesel fuel is an oil so the pistons
and cylinder walls don't wear out as fast a gasoline engines with the
accumulation of mileage.</p>
<p>For the <a href="../b5/glow-plug-removal-passat.htm">VW Passat TDI compression test</a>, see this article. </p>
<p>If you have a PD engine (BRM, BEW, BHW), also see the Passat article since some tips apply to your car.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>Clean the area around the glow plugs.&nbsp; The glow plug wiring harness is
marked in red below, the green mark is for another writeup.&nbsp; The area around them tend to
collect dirt and sand, things you don't want falling into the engine.&nbsp; You
can use compressed air or wad some paper towels and use some carb cleaner on the
metal to clean up.&nbsp; Always wear eye protection!<br>

<p>Warm up the engine to operating temperature.&nbsp; The metal parts of an engine expand when they get hot, so ice cold
and warm engines will have slightly different compression.&nbsp; Remove all
the glow plugs.&nbsp; Refer to <a href="glowplugreplace.htm">glow plug
replacement</a> for more details.&nbsp; The below picture is from another
&quot;how to&quot; so ignore the red circle.&nbsp; It illustrates the glow plug
harness and #1 glow plug removed.&nbsp; Note that the #1 spot was cleaned, the
other spots were still dirty.</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/noz2.jpg" width="787" height="433"></p>
<p>Take your compression tester and find the correct adapter.&nbsp; Remember: do
NOT use a gasoline car compression tester because the ranges are completely different.&nbsp;
If the compression tester isn't holding pressure, a common problem is the stem inside the adapter coming loose.&nbsp; Use a
valve stem tightening tool or very thin pliers to turn the spring loaded stem
inside the adapter clockwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test by threading the adapter GENTLY into the glow plug hole.&nbsp; If it
does not go in smoothly for at least a few turns, you may be stripping the
threads - STOP and check it.&nbsp; In some cars, the glow plugs do not go straight into
the cylinder head, the threads are at an angle, so beware of parallax (viewing
error)!&nbsp;
Please read <a href="auto-mechanics-tips.htm#parallax">1000q:
mechanics tips - parallax</a> for more details on viewing errors.&nbsp; One
trick you can try is to turn the screw/adapter/bolt/etc., counterclockwise to loosen
it and get the threads seated, and so you can &quot;feel&quot; the threads, then turning clockwise to tighten.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attach the compression tester and disconnect the fuel pump relay or
plug.&nbsp; On 2003 and earlier VW diesels, just follow the wires coming out of
the fuel injection pump to find the plug.&nbsp; In the above picture, removing
the black plug at the center-bottom of the picture will keep the fuel shut off
solenoid from letting fuel pass and keep the pump off.&nbsp; Mk4 cars are
similar.&nbsp; You DON'T want fuel getting injected into
the engine while you are testing it because the engine will try to run on its
own!&nbsp; Again, make sure there are no sources of ignition or sparks nearby!</p>
<p>Make sure the car is in neutral or &quot;Park&quot; before cranking the
engine.&nbsp; Note that you want all the cylinders not being tested to have their
glow plugs removed so that they are not building compression.&nbsp; This absorbs
the energy of the engine cranking, and can affect the compression readings and
unnecessarily drain the battery.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use an assistant to turn the engine to &quot;start&quot; for 4-5
engine cranking revolutions
so you can note how far and how fast the compression tester needle moves.&nbsp;
Keep cranking the engine until the compression does not rise any further.&nbsp;
Then do it again to double check.&nbsp; Move to the other cylinders and write down the values so you can compare them
later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike a gasoline engine, adding oil is not recommended due to the high
compression in the cylinder.&nbsp; You risk having the compression tester be damaged
or personal injury due to the cylinder firing.&nbsp; Remember, a diesel engine
can run on oil and the peak compression reached from the combustion process is in the thousands,
way beyond the range of the compression tester.&nbsp; In addition, if you do a
compression test and the results are bad, you can do the test again.&nbsp; There
would be no point in adding oil since you already know there is some problem
either with the gauge or engine.</p>
<p>If the readings are still unsatisfactory, replace the glow plugs and start
the engine.&nbsp; Run it until the engine is fully warmed up and repeat the
test.&nbsp; If the readings are still unsatisfactory,
then there may be a problem with the compression tester (may be
inaccurate/broken), a poor seal or stripped threads around the glow plug hole,
bad fuel injector seals/washers.&nbsp; More serious would be bad valves, rings,
pistons, or worn cylinders.&nbsp; At this point, you can be sure that something
is wrong with the engine or compression tester. </p>

<p>Also keep in mind that two different compression testers may show different
readings on the same engine.&nbsp; Professional grade testers tend to be more
accurate then cheaper gauges which can show slightly higher or lower readings.&nbsp; In this
case, don't worry about a slightly low reading within spec- as long as the compression is
consistent across all of the cylinders and the engine idles well, starts in the
winter, and isn't pouring smoke, it is
acceptable and I wouldn't worry about it.&nbsp; Keep in mind that high altitude
will also lower compression test readings. </p>

<p>For example, VW diesel engines have a spec of 360-450 psi with new
engines.&nbsp; It is only considered a bad engine if the reading is below 276 or
there is a difference of more than 73 psi between cylinders.&nbsp; That is a lot
of allowable variance.&nbsp; To put it in perspective, gasoline engines
typically can have no more than 15 psi difference between cylinders on engine
compression of about 125-180 psi, depending on the car.&nbsp; If you need more
detailed information about the condition of the engine, then a leakdown
test or a better compression tester is recommended.&nbsp; Consulting a mechanic
would also be a good next step. </p>
