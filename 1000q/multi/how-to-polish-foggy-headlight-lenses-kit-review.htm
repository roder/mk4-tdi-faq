<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b>
<h2><font size="3">This article shows how to polish and clean your foggy dull yellowed headlight lenses to
clear.&nbsp; I also review the 3M headlight polishing kit.</font></h2>

<p>Glass headlight lenses are no longer used in non-sealed beam headlights
on most US cars.&nbsp; All plastic headlight lenses will pit and
oxidize with age and wear.&nbsp; Polishing will restore their clarity and make
the car look much better.&nbsp; It's not just a cosmetic issue, it's also a safety issue for you and
oncoming cars.&nbsp; Cloudy or hazy headlights diffuse the light and create glare for
oncoming cars by scattering the light.&nbsp; HID lights will have unacceptable
dazzle if the lenses are cloudy.</p>

<p>Here is an example of before and after polishing.&nbsp; You can see speckled
pits in the plastic which catch the light in the before picture.&nbsp; In the
after picture, the city light (the
small parking light) and its reflection are sharp and there's a lot less scattered
light and glare from the foggy lens.&nbsp; Less glare from
clear lenses means
more light onto the road.&nbsp; The picture angle is slightly different but the
results aren't a camera trick - it's clear that the amount of glare and lens
fogginess is a lot less.<br>

<p>Headlight lenses may also have a hardened or UV layer.&nbsp; If you have to
sand the lens to this layer to get to clear plastic, they will fog up more
frequently.&nbsp; Once you
polish the headlights, I suggest buying thin vinyl headlight
protecting film with UV resistance so that you don't have to polish them again for a
long time.&nbsp;
Professional installation of the film is suggested, especially if they're
curved.&nbsp; The other option is to
do a final
polish once a season to keep them clear.</p>

<p>There are headlight polishing kits available at auto parts stores but I
suggest using the ones that use power tools.&nbsp; Power tools
are much faster and produce much better results than hand polishing.&nbsp; I strongly suggest a mother's powerball
mini and plastic headlight polish.&nbsp; Even if you do buy the polishing kits I still
prefer the powerball mini over their foam polishers.&nbsp; Its rotation and contact
surface is more consistent, easily controlled, and will give better results
because of the many fingers and attaches to any power drill.&nbsp; The full sized powerball or porter cable polisher pads
are too large and the powerball for paint is too soft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font size="3">How to polish the taillights</font></h3>
Taillights are not exposed to the same pitting but could still benefit from
polishing.&nbsp; You use the same materials so it only requires a few more
minutes.&nbsp; After you're done with the headlights, use the mother's powerball
mini on the taillights and side corner marker lights.&nbsp; It'll make the colors
&quot;pop&quot; more and clear up scratched plastic.&nbsp; Don't use any
sandpaper on them unless they are extremely bad.

<h3><font size="3">3M headlight restoration system review</font></h3>

<p>It's a good value if you find
it on sale or have a complex curved headlight.&nbsp; The foam pad follows sharp curves better
than a flat electric sander.&nbsp; Here is what's included in the 3M headlight polishing kit: headlight
polish, polishing pad, disc attachment for the power drill, 3000 foam pad, 800 sanding
disks, and 500 sanding disks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light3.jpg" width="691" height="504"></p>

<p>I found better and faster results using a power sander and a mothers
powerball mini.&nbsp; The main problem is that the 3M kit's 500 sandpaper is
pretty rough and the 800 seems soft.&nbsp; There's twice as many 500 sanding
disks than you would ever need and too few higher grit.&nbsp; After the 800 they
go up to 3000 pad and a polishing pad that is too soft.&nbsp; I found it left
swirls because the change in grit is too great.&nbsp; If you buy the 3M kit
avoid using the 500 grit paper and start with the 800.&nbsp; I also still
recommend a powerball mini if you buy the kit because it works better.&nbsp; The
3M pad rotates as a flat pad perpendicular to the drill's
axis.&nbsp; The outside diameter of the pad moves much faster than the inside
diameter of the pad which is barely moving at all.&nbsp; The powerball mini rotates parallel to the drill's axis and gives
more consistent force.&nbsp; The powerball also has many foam fingers that polish
each stroke vs. the 3M foam pad which uses a flat surface.</p>

<h3><font size="3">My recommendation on parts for DIY headlight polishing kit</font></h3>
Because the 3M kit is designed to be sanded dry and because of the big
change in grit, I recommend putting together your own kit.&nbsp; The 3M kit
works well if you start with 800 and use a powerball mini.&nbsp; It's also good
if you are only going to sand the headlights once and the only tool you have is
a power drill.&nbsp; I've tried it a few times and but the best and fastest results
I've gotten are always with a DIY kit.&nbsp; I recommend a power wet/dry sander
starting with 800 grit wet/dry sandpaper, then 1500 wet/dry, then the powerball
mini with plastic polish.

<p>Pictured is my DIY kit - plastX plastic polish, a powerball mini, and a
wet/dry electric sander.<br>

<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>

<p> First, is the inside of the lens clean?&nbsp; Some projector headlights tend
to get dusty on the insides.&nbsp; Use a grabber tool like craftsman 41322 and wrap the end in
tape to prevent scratches.&nbsp; Then use the grabber to hold a clean
microfiber cloth.&nbsp; You can also use a lint free cleaning cloth.&nbsp; Make
sure the metal grabber fingers are covered and wrap the grabber in tape if you
are concerned about scratches.&nbsp; Put a small amount of no
residue window cleaner on it.&nbsp; Remove the light bulbs and stick the grabber
tool through the bulb holes to wipe the lens clean from the inside.&nbsp; You
shouldn't be able to see through projector headlight lens but you should be able
to tell if it's dusty or clean.&nbsp; Don't use water or alcohol to fill the
inside of the housing to clean it because some headlights have a moisture
absorbing tablet.&nbsp; If it gets totally soaked it can break up and cause lots
of dust particles inside to float around.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light15.jpg" width="396" height="176"><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light16.jpg" width="599" height="146"></p>

<p> Then wash the exterior of the lens.</p>

<p> If the headlights are in good condition without fogging, just use a powerball mini and some plastic polish.&nbsp; Move
the polisher up-down, left-right, crosshatched and in a diagonal
pattern to cover the entire lens.&nbsp; That should be enough to polish the
lens.&nbsp; If you have the 3M kit, just use the 3000 gray pad (softer than
sandpaper) and follow up with polish.&nbsp; If there are visible pits or fogging
you'll have to sand them down as described below.</p>

<p>Start by taping off the paint around the headlights with painter's
tape.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The headlights below needed stronger sandpaper in the first stage to remove the surface defects and the yellowed oxidized layer of plastic.&nbsp;
Don't spend too much time with 500 grit since it's pretty
rough.&nbsp; If you are putting together your own kit I would start with 800
sandpaper.&nbsp; You can see the final result with these lights at the bottom of the page.</p>

<p>If you're using a flat electric sander, move it back and forth, up and down, and
diagonally.&nbsp; Wet/dry sandpaper is supposed to be wet and form a slurry as
you sand.&nbsp; This prevents the sandpaper from getting loaded.&nbsp; If you are using the 3M pad, hold it at a slight angle to the surface instead of
perfectly flat to the surface.&nbsp; This puts the sanding surface over one edge
and gives better contact control over the
pad.&nbsp; This is because as the circular pad rotates, the
center moves slower than the outer diameter.&nbsp; Don't pause in any spot too
long or else it will burn the lens.&nbsp; If the pad is getting loaded then
brush it clean.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light5.jpg" width="480" height="360"><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light9.jpg" width="411" height="346"></p>

<p>This headlight isn't as foggy and only needs 800 grit to smooth it
out.&nbsp; Use the minimum grit required to smooth out your lens.&nbsp;&nbsp;Any
stronger will result in swirl lines and scratches later on.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light14.jpg" width="540" height="272"></p>

<p>If you see wavy lines after sanding, the surface of the lens isn't completely
flat.&nbsp; The wavy lines are from the high spots getting sanded down and the
low spots not.&nbsp; Go back and sand them down.&nbsp; The headlights should appear cloudy but uniform.&nbsp;
Rinse off the slurry and determine if you need to sand some more.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light6.jpg" width="480" height="360"></p>

<p>Use a higher grit sandpaper at each step.&nbsp; The 3M kit tells you to use
800 grit, then the 3000 foam pad.&nbsp; If you are using your own materials I
would suggest using 800, then 1500. </p>
<p>Examine the lens - there should be no wavy lines.&nbsp; If there are, go back
and sand some more.&nbsp; Once it's smooth and uniform, polish the
lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>The powerball mini
is just the right size and shape for the headlights and I prefer it over the pad
provided in the 3M kit.&nbsp; Push the polish into
the powerball and spread it around to avoid flinging and wasted polish.&nbsp;
Move it up/down, rotate the powerball rotation axis and move it around
left/right, rotate it again, and move it around again.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/detailing/light7.jpg" width="480" height="360"> </p>
<p>The final result is clear headlights!&nbsp; To prevent
the lenses from
getting pitted again, use UV resistant plastic film to protect
from future damage or specially designed headlight protectors.&nbsp; These are
difficult to apply without bubbles or defects so professional installation is recommended.&nbsp; If you buy a new car, get headlight protectors so it will never need polishing in
the future.&nbsp; At some point the headlight protectors will wear down but you
can just peel off the old layer, wipe away any adhesive, and apply another
protector.</p>
<p>If you insist on installing the film yourself, here are instructions and tips
for installing most vinyl lens covers.&nbsp; Use a spritzer of water with a tiny
drop of soap in it.&nbsp; Mist the surface to help the film adhesive glide
on.&nbsp; Start at the top and use a squeegee to press the film flat as you
press it on to squeeze the water out.&nbsp; Lubricate the outside of the film as
you squeegee.&nbsp; The film can be pulled up and reapplied as long as it's
wet.&nbsp; You can use a hair dryer to shrink any wrinkles and tighten the film
around curves but too much will burn or wrinkle the film.</p>
<p>Below is a video demo.&nbsp; It take practices to get good at it and the more
curved the lens, the harder installation will be.&nbsp; The film should last at
least a few years before it needs removal and replacement.<br>

<p>The powerball mini can also be used on the turn signals or side markers and
rear taillights.&nbsp; Since the taillights are not bombarded with road
debris, you'll only need to polish.&nbsp; After polishing,
the colors will appear much more vibrant and &quot;pop&quot; more due to
smoother plastic.<br>
