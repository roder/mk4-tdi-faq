<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>

<h2>This article shows how to replace the 5th gear or swap it for a taller 5th
gear on your VW transmission.&nbsp; A TDI is shown.&nbsp;</h2>

<p> The procedure is very similar for all mk3, mk4, and early mk5
VW or Audi with the 5 speed manual, 1996-2006 New Beetle, Golf, Jetta, and
Passat.&nbsp; They use different transmissions with different gearing but the
procedure is similar.&nbsp; This procedure is
not applicable to automatic transmissions because they don't use the same gears or
gear ratios as a manual transmission.&nbsp; This modification won't work on the
2009+ TDI since their manual transmission
is 6 speed.</p>

<p>The taller gear will lower engine rpm when in 5th gear.&nbsp; This reduces engine noise and
slightly increases fuel
economy.&nbsp; After doing the 5th gear swap, I was surprised at all
the new noises I heard due to a quieter cabin!&nbsp; That's how much
more relaxed the engine sounds at normal highway driving speeds.&nbsp; Your
road surface and tires are another major factor on how quiet the car is.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
difference in gearing from your current setup will also determine results.&nbsp;
See <a href="../tire-wheel-gearing-calculator.htm">1000q: wheel/gearing/tire calculator</a>
 to see the exact numbers.</p>
<p>Engine load will
increase at the same speed due to the change in mechanical advantage and engine rpm.&nbsp;
At average highway speeds, reducing rpm puts the engine into a
slightly more efficient area of operation vs. before.&nbsp; You could expect as much as a 4% increase in fuel economy but most
people see 2% or none at all.&nbsp; This is because you could spend more time in 4th gear
depending on your driving habits and few people drive all highway.&nbsp; You will also notice less available acceleration in 5th gear.&nbsp;
It
shouldn't require downshifting unless you want to pass on a steep hill and
are lugging the engine.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, I would not recommend doing this swap if you drive mostly in a city
or only 10 minutes to work because you won't spend much time in 5th gear and will not realize
the benefit.&nbsp; In fact,
if you find yourself in 4th gear more often due to the gearing, your fuel economy could actually get
slightly worse.&nbsp; If you plan on selling the car soon I wouldn't recommend it.&nbsp; Otherwise,
most people are happy with a 5th gear swap.&nbsp; After driving your car with the new
5th gear, you will realize that this is how VW should have geared their diesel
cars, especially the mk3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Doing the 5th gear mod is almost like losing 5th gear but gaining a 6th double
overdrive gear.&nbsp; It's comparable to a double overdrive rather than a
traditional 6th gear because most 6 gear manual transmission gear
ratios put 6th gear near where a regular 5th gear is.&nbsp; In other words, most
6 gear transmissions are just more closely spaced and more suitable
for low torque engines.&nbsp; A double overdrive puts a taller gear above the
first overdrive 5th gear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This is also a chance to change the manual
transmission gear oil, something that should
be done every 60-100,000 miles anyways.&nbsp; After removing your old 5th gear, you can sell it to a gasoline VW
owner to reduce the final cost of the project.&nbsp; Their cars use the 020, 02J, or 02A
transmission but with shorter gearing and final drive.&nbsp; Your old 5th gear
will drop their 5th gear rpm by about 400 rpm!&nbsp; So although the initial
cost of the gear kit, gear oil, and shipping is about $350, you can sell your old gears for
$100-150!</p>

<p>Note: If you have a mk3 Passat up to 97, there isn't
very
much room to work because the unibody near the
frame rails blocks the end of the transmission.&nbsp; You need to find a low-clearance gear
puller because it's a machined fit and
pulling on it with your hand or trying to pry it out won't do anything but cause
damage.&nbsp; The mk3 Jetta and all mk4 and newer cars have a removable plastic fender liner
over the end of the transmission case and plenty of room.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: If you have a mk4 pumpe duse
(2004-2006), the
transmission is slightly different and the cruise control may not work if you
change the 5th gear.&nbsp; Mechanically the new gear will work great but the cruise
control gets discombobulated and may sometimes cut out or stop working
entirely.&nbsp; It might work fine but most people report that it doesn't.&nbsp;
This is only a problem on mk4 with the <a href="../pumpedusedesc.htm">pumpe
duse engine</a>.</p>
<p>Note: mk3 and mk4 gears should be interchangeable. However, there's been 1 case where putting mk4 5th gear into a mk3 caused a rattle. <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f4/5th-gear-swap-rattle-problem-videos-help-28094/">See this forum post for details</a>.</p>

<h3>Gear ratio details</h3>
<p>Here is a listing of stock gear ratios.&nbsp; Because you will change the 5th gear
only, your car's gearing will not change in gears 1 through 4.&nbsp; That would
only happen if you changed the final drive or increased the tire/wheel size.&nbsp; There are a few choices for
5th gear ratios.&nbsp; Most people will be happiest with .681 because it lowers rpm
enough to be worth the expense and time and doesn't create an excessive gap between 4th and 5th
gears.&nbsp; The loss of torque with a taller .658 5th
gear is too great for some people so if you're not sure of which ratio to
choose, I suggest getting .681. </p>
<p>To see the exact engine RPM that a gearing change will produce, refer to <a href="../tire-wheel-gearing-calculator.htm">1000q:
Tire, wheel, offset, and gearing calculator</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><b>MK3</b> <br>
The stock 5th gear ratio in the 02A is .755.<br>
The final drive is 3.157<br>
It uses VW g50 fully synthetic gear oil 75w/90.<br>

<p><b>Mk4 pumpe duse (2004-2005, 2006, new beetle slightly different)</b><br>
The stock 5th gear ratio in the 02J is .744.&nbsp; <br>
The final drive is 3.389.<br>
It uses g 052 726 a2 gear oil.</p>
<p><b>Mk5 (2005.5-2006)</b><br>
The stock 5th gear ratio in the OA4 (GQQ) transmission is .769<br>
The final drive is 3.389<br>
There's a trick to changing the mk5 Jetta 5 speed transmission gear oil, see <a href="../a5/manual-gear-Oil-Volkswagen-Jetta-TDI.htm">1000q:
mk5 trans oil</a> for details.</p>
<p><b>New 5th gear ratios</b>: you can purchase either .658, .681, or
.717.&nbsp; Note that .658 requires modification to the spring plate, which is
outside the scope of this article.&nbsp;  It also drops rpm by 13% which is too much
for most people.&nbsp; If you have any doubt, don't get .658.
 </p>
<p>.681 drops rpm by 11% which is large enough to
be worth the effort.&nbsp; .717 is a good choice to combine with large tires and
for mostly stock power cars.&nbsp; However, make sure the rpm drop is worth it
to you.</p>
<p> US dealers will not even order these
parts for you since it's not in their standard ordering system.&nbsp; I had a friend in Germany price the parts in
Euros and after
shipping, it would have cost more than just buying from a US seller, so I recommend
a local seller.&nbsp; Below is an example of gearing changes in an mk4 TDI at
different speeds and rpms.&nbsp; To see the exact engine RPM that a gearing change will produce,

<h3>Gearing swap procedure</h3>
<p>First, make sure that you have all the required tools and inspect the
parts.&nbsp; Remove the driver's side front wheel, jack up the car, rest the car on
jackstands, and chock the rear wheels as necessary.&nbsp; Make sure the car is
in gear and the parking brake is applied.&nbsp; Comply with all safety precautions
specified in the factory service manual.&nbsp; Make sure the car is safe and
secure before getting underneath the car!&nbsp; To see where I put jack stands
on my mk4 Jetta, see <a href="../a4/jackpoints.htm">1000q: mk4 jack stands</a>
.&nbsp; For the mk5 see <a href="../a5/jack-stand-lift-point-mk5.htm">1000q: my Jetta's jack
stands</a>.</p>
<p>Remove the black plastic splash shield under the engine and the driver's side plastic
cover (pass side shown below for illustration).&nbsp; It's held in place with speed nuts and 1 torx screw.&nbsp; (1996-7
passat have the unibody structure here.&nbsp; If you have a mk3 passat, you must
determine now if your gear puller will fit in the limited clearance.&nbsp; If
not, stop now and attempt the job again when you have the proper tools).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb11.jpg" width="714" height="310"></p>
<p>Drain the gear oil with the 17mm allen wrench.&nbsp; As always, make sure you
can open the fill hole first!&nbsp; Refer to these links for more details and

How to change the manual transmission gear oil mk5 Jetta</a></p>
<p>Remove the power steering line if it's in the way and remove the
transmission end cover (10mm x 5 bolts, circled in red below).&nbsp; Some gear
oil will seep out so I suggest removing the bolts at the top first.&nbsp; When
you remove the bolts at the bottom, have some paper towels and the catch pan
ready.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> Here is a picture of what the mk4 looks like.&nbsp; The
power steering line is in the way.&nbsp; The plastic
side panel has been removed.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gears2.jpg" width="597" height="436"></p>
<p>Below left is a picture of a mk3 Passat viewed from below.&nbsp; You don't
have a power steering line in the way but there's very little clearance because of the frame.&nbsp; Your
gear puller must be low profile and fit between the red marks.&nbsp;
You could cut the non-structural part of the car, bend it back temporarily,
and weld it back but I would rather use a low profile puller.</p>
<p>Below right is a picture of a mk3 jetta, like the mk4 cars, there should be
plenty of room and no power steering line in the way.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gears1.jpg" width="360" height="480">&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gears11.jpg" width="677" height="519"></p>
<p>You should now see the 5th gear (outlined in green underneath the
selector gear), the selector
gear (outlined in red), the selector lever (outlined in blue), and the small gear
you need to remove.&nbsp; Warning: check the clearance
of your gear puller!&nbsp; This is the last step where you can still stop the
job.&nbsp; If you proceed, you may pass the point of no return:&nbsp; removing
any one of the major components <u>could</u> require you to remove the rest of the
components to put it all back, or at least make it much easier!<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gears3.jpg" width="640" height="480"> </p>

<p>Remove the 8mm triple square bolts circled in purple.&nbsp; Then remove the
gear selector pins and gear selector lever.&nbsp; Here is a picture of the parts
removed from the car.&nbsp; Note that the top pin was removed, the bottom pin is
in place with it's 8mm triple square bolt.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gears4.jpg" width="345" height="480"> </p>

<p>Next, remove the T60 bolts that hold everything in (circled in
purple below).&nbsp; Your bolts may be slightly different sizes.&nbsp; There is a
belleville washer underneath the bolt.&nbsp; Note its direction
and shape - it's not flat!&nbsp; You can use a permanent marker to mark
the faces.&nbsp; To counterhold against the gear, have someone step on the brakes and
put the car in gear while you remove the bolts.&nbsp; It might move a little if
it's tight.&nbsp; If you put the car on wood blocks and have the wheels securely
chocked, the weight of the car will be on the wheels so having the car in gear
w/brakes on should be enough to counterhold them.&nbsp; Having the car on jack
stands with the front wheels in the air means only the brakes are
counterholding.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Note how flush the belleville washer and gears
are against the shafts.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gears5.jpg" width="640" height="480"> </p>

<p>Note - most late mk4 cars used a M14 triple square bolt instead of a T60
bolt.&nbsp; All mk5 cars use a M14 triple square.&nbsp; This is shown below (the
small gear was damaged).&nbsp; A triple square is a common VW/Audi 12 point bit
and not a torx so don't try to use a torx on it!<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gear11.jpg" width="720" height="555"> </p>

<p>The selector gear has 2 circlip springs one in front, one in back.&nbsp;
These do not hold the gear in place.&nbsp; I suggest removing the top circlip so you
can fit a gear puller arm into the slots.</p>
<p>You must use a gear puller to remove the selector gear (circled in red in the
pics above) which is pressed in.&nbsp; If you can't fit the gear puller arms
in place, you may have to file them down to fit.&nbsp; Here are some tips to get the gear off:
it's pressed on so don't
try to pry it off!&nbsp; Try using PB blaster and squirt it around the center
section.&nbsp; Also try removing the washer but leaving the bolt partially
threaded in with a gap for something to leave the gear puller bolt to push
against.&nbsp; You can also use heat from a blowtorch to heat the selector ring. </p>

<p> You need a low profile gear puller if you have an mk3 Passat.&nbsp; I didn't
have one and it was late, so I made one myself.&nbsp; I used a small gear puller
center section and 2 small gear puller arms.&nbsp; Note that 1 arm tip is wide,
1 arm tip is narrow (You can't really see this in the picture, but this is to
fit into the selector ring slots.&nbsp; The slots alternate 1 wide, 1
narrow).&nbsp; Then I took old allen wrenches, used a blowtorch to soften
them, and bent them into s-shapes to
hold the gear puller arms. Don't bother using soft metal because it won't hold
the force of pulling the gears.&nbsp; Note that the arms are directly
opposite each other.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/ghettopuller.jpg" width="613" height="277"> </p>

<p>Here is the gear selector with the circlip wire spring installed.&nbsp; Note how the locks fit into the narrow slots.&nbsp;
The wide slots are empty.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/selector.jpg" width="640" height="570"></p>
<p>Once the selector gear is removed, the 5th gear just comes off.&nbsp; You MUST remove the large gear and the selector gear
BEFORE you remove the
small gear.&nbsp; The small gear will not come off before the large gear comes
off.</p>
<p>Clean everything.&nbsp; Now clean it again!<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gear6.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The needle bearing just slides off by hand.&nbsp; In the above
picture you should be able to see how the gear spins freely until it's locked by the selector
gear.</p>
<p>Here is a comparison of the old and new gears.&nbsp; The
old large gear still has the needle bearing on the inside edge (top left gear).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gear7.jpg" width="450" height="387"></p>
<p>Here is a picture of the selector ring.&nbsp; Note the grooved tooth (center
of pic) where the
locking teeth sits.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gear8.jpg" width="640" height="382"></p>
<p>Here is the selector gear.&nbsp; The bronze synchronizer sits between the 5th
gear and the selector gear with the teeth pointing away from the trans.&nbsp;
The locking teeth are held by the circlips, one above the ring and one below the
selector ring.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gear9.jpg" width="640" height="544"></p>
<p>For reassembly, clean everything again.&nbsp; Remember to put the small gear on first, then
the large gear w/needle bearing.&nbsp; Then the selector gear.&nbsp; Press them
in with a clean block of wood and a hammer or a clean dead blow mallet.&nbsp;&nbsp;Optional
but suggested: heating the gears will make them expand and make them easier to
press on.&nbsp; Putting them in an oven for 20 minutes at about 300-350<sup>o</sup>F
should warm them up nicely.&nbsp; A torch won't do too much.&nbsp; You can use
pliers and a heat resistant glove like the Ove Glove to handle the hot gears.</p>
<p>The washers are not flat washers!&nbsp; You may be able to see wear grooves
on the inside or outside edge of the washer.&nbsp; They are belleville lock
washer springs and are shaped like a cone to
apply pressure against the gear and T60 bolt.&nbsp; If the washer isn't snug it's
on backwards.&nbsp; In the below picture, the washer on the large
gear is on backwards - you can see the wear ring on the outer edge - it should be on
the inner edge.&nbsp; Torque the bolt to spec and that should press the gears
back on if they weren't 100% on.</p>
<p>Reinstall the selector lever and pins.&nbsp; Clean the gasket and cover
surfaces and reinstall the cover.&nbsp; Refill with gear oil.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/5th_gear/gear10.jpg" width="462" height="421"></p>
<h4>Torque specs:</h4>
<p>T60 bolts: 59 ft lbs (80 Nm)<br>
8mm triple square selector lever bolts: 18 ft lbs (25 Nm)<br>
Transmission cover bolts: 9 ft lbs</p>
<p>Go for a test drive and check for any leaks.&nbsp; If everything is okay,
go sell your 5th gear to a VW gasser!&nbsp; All of the VW mk3 and mk4 cars that
are 5 speed can use this gear.&nbsp; (No 6 speed or automatics)</p>
