<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>The recommended method of bleeding the brakes in the VW service manual is to
bleed them under pressure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> You can buy one or you can make your own.&nbsp;
First, always use new parts because you don't want to mix chemicals in the
bleeder.&nbsp; Be careful when working with brake fluid - keep it off the paint
because it will quickly eat your
paint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are pictures of what you are making:&nbsp; It can cost about $50 less than
a retail brake bleeder with similar functionality.&nbsp; These are not
professional pressure brake bleeders, nor are the ones you can buy for
$100.&nbsp; Professional pressure brake bleeders use a diaphragm like an air
bladder to separate the pressurized air from the brake fluid.&nbsp; This keeps air and moisture from being
mixed with clean fluid.&nbsp; The
tiny bit of air should not make any noticeable difference and is not visible to
the naked eye but it's there.&nbsp;&nbsp; A professional shop machine also needs
to hold gallons of fluid for many jobs. Pics and tips mirrored from:

<p><b><font size="4">Parts</font></b></p>
<p>1 gallon sprayer<br>
Hose Barb Adapter<br>
Pipe Bushing&nbsp;<br>
10' of 3/8" vinyl clear tubing&nbsp;<br>
ATE N3030-33314 brake master cylinder cap (pictured below)- fits VW and some
other euro cars<br>
small washers and o rings</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>
<p>Take the master cylinder cap and remove the inner cap/seal.&nbsp; Drill a hole in it
and put the hose barb through the hole.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/brakef1.jpg" width="500" height="388">&nbsp; <img border="0" src="../../images/misc/brakef2.jpg" width="500" height="316"></p>
<p>You don't want to crush the o-ring, just snug it on.&nbsp; Over tightened
o-rings are a main cause of twisted and pinched o-rings and leaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snip off the end of the sprayer wand and clamp the vinyl hose to both
ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/brakef5.jpg" width="500" height="303">&nbsp;</p>
<p> Optional:&nbsp; attach a bike valve to use an air compressor for
pressurizing the sprayer or to
check the pressure.&nbsp; Recommended pressure is 10-14 psi, anything more could
damage the brake master cylinder seals or encourage a loose hose to pop off and
spray brake fluid everywhere.&nbsp;<br>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use, attach the cap to the brake fluid reservoir and pressurize the
bleeder.&nbsp; Fluid will go through the hose and into the brake fluid
reservoir.&nbsp; Just make sure to not over pressurize the sprayer and to relieve
the pressure from the sprayer slowly.&nbsp; As always, wear safety glasses and
follow all precautions in your factory service manual.&nbsp; Remove any excess fluid in the
master cylinder reservoir with a turkey baster when you are done.&nbsp; </p>
