<p><b><font size="4">Wheel fitment guide</font></b></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p>This article is the wheel fitment guide for VW and Audi.&nbsp; It applies to both
factory OEM VW and Audi wheels and aftermarket wheels.</p>
<p><strong>Lug patterns (Bolt Pattern)</strong></p>
<p>When choosing wheels, they must have exactly the 4x100, 5x100, 5x112
  lug pattern, depending on year, and at least 57.1 mm centerbore.&nbsp; See <a href="../wheels/oem-vw-audi-wheels-gallery-database.htm">1000q:
wheels overview</a> for your model year's lug pattern</p>
<p>The first number in the lug
pattern, for example &quot;5&quot; means that the wheel uses 5 studs/lugs.&nbsp;
The second number means how far apart the lugs are, for example 100mm or 112 mm apart.&nbsp;
The wheel must match this lug pattern unless you
have a custom lug pattern.&nbsp; For example, the Touareg lugs are spaced 130mm
apart so they will not fit jettas, passats, or golfs, without a lug pattern adapter.</p>
<p>It's possible to fit other lug patterns with an adapter plate which bolt to your hub but these add thickness to the hub and push the wheel out. The problem is that these can push the wheel out toof far. These are best reserved for wheels with high offsets so that the final result is close to what came stock on your car.</p>
<p><strong>Hub Bore and Centerbore</strong></p>
<p> Hub bore or centerbore is the diameter of the central hole in your wheels and the  projection on the wheel hub the wheel rests on. Since the wheel is
  centered on the hub it's called a <b>hubcentric wheel</b>. VW and Audi centerbores are 57.1mm and all OEM VW Audi wheels are hubcentric. Aftermarket wheels make the centerbore large enough to fit many different make/models and then use hubcentric rings to adapt the centerbore diameter down to something that will fit on your hub. If the wheel isn't designed for hubcentric wheels it's lugcentric because it's centered by the wheel lugs/bolts. Lugcentric wheels are much
  harder to center than hubcentric wheels due to the fact that it is not centered
  on a central projection. For this reason lugcentric wheels are more prone to
  vibration and shimmys at speed, if mounted correctly however, lugcentric wheels
  can be trouble free. </p>
<p><b>Hubcentric rings</b></p>
<p>These are metal or plastic rings that snugly fill the
gap between the larger wheel centerbore to match the hub's smaller centerbore.&nbsp;
They are generally needed for aftermarket wheels because this allows the
wheel manufacturer to allow the same wheel to fit with many different cars.&nbsp; Do not
attempt to bore out a centerbore that is too small, it may weaken the wheel and
may not be properly machined and round. Just find another wheel that will properly fit.&nbsp; Rings are
generally made out of metal (which can rust) or&nbsp;plastic (which can become
damaged).&nbsp; I recommend plastic rings because the damage threshold is still
very high and few people have any problems with them.&nbsp;
Metal rings will rust or corrode over time, losing fitment or getting stuck, so
I prefer plastic rings.</p>
<p><b>Offset</b> 
<p>Offset is the difference between the hub face and wheel
centerline. A range of
42 to 30 usually works on the MKIII or MKIV, but remember that offset alone means nothing:
offset, spoke design, and overall wheel width all play a part in whether or not a wheel will fit under the
fenders AND clear the brake and suspension components.&nbsp; A 10&quot; wheel with an offset of 15 will fit under the rear of a MKIV
without much fuss, the same can not be said about a 10&quot; wheel with a +42
offset. Even different model tires of the same width will have different shaped sidewalls which affect clearance - some will be more square and some will be more round.<p>If a wheel sticks out beyond the fenders of the car, this is called
&quot;poke&quot;, wheels that poke are usually either significantly wider than
normal with a low offset (10&quot; with an offset of +15) or normal size with a
very low offset (7&quot; with an offset of 0 or below).
<p>If a wheel is inside the fender line it is generally called
&quot;tucked&quot; (subject to lowering). To tuck wheels you need to run higher
offsets and/or skinner wheels (remember it is a combination of Offset and
Width). If you run very high offsets you run the risk of the tire/wheel rubbing
on the inner fender, or even worse, not being able to fit in the wheel well at
all. Wheels are usually stamped with their offset using the German prefix
&quot;ET&quot; meaning &quot;Einpresstiefe&quot;, or literally, &quot;insertion
depth&quot;. An example would be &quot;ET45&quot; for a 45mm offset.
<p><b>Spacers</b>
<p>Wheel spacers can be used to change the offset of a wheel. By bolting
between the wheel and the wheel hub, they push the wheel further &quot;out&quot;
from the car. Spacers SUBTRACT offset from a wheel setup. Therefore if you want
to run an et 55 offset wheel (popular OEM Porsche application), you will need
either a 15 or 20 mm spacer to end up with an offset in the acceptable range
(et40 or et 35).
<p>In general there is a lot of room to play with offset. Stock for MKIII and
MKIV cars is about is 35-38, but
depending on the width of the wheel, you can go lower or higher than that. Also,
there is a significant different between what you can get away with on the front
(skinnier) vs. the rear (wider).
<p><b>Diameter</b> - From the factory MKIV's have been equipped with 15, 16, 17
and 18 inch wheels. 14 inch wheels will not clear the front brakes on any car,
and 19 and 20 inch wheels have been fitted (19's easier than 20's).
<p>The following applies ONLY to cars without brake upgrades.<br>
19's will fit any MKIV<br>
18's will fit any MKIV<br>
17's will fit any MKIV<br>
16's will fit any MKIV EXCEPT R32's<br>
15's will fit any MKIV EXCEPT 337's, 20AE's, or 1.8T (2004.5+) GLI's
<p>*These are subject to certain offset and wheel design restrictions (ie.
Wolfsburg wheels are 16&quot; but will not fit on 337's, 20aes, or 1.8t GLI's
without a spacer)</p>
<p><b>Wheel Bolts</b> - Stock wheel bolts are 14x1.5x28 (wire size x thread
  pitch x length). Longer wheel bolts are needed for adpaters or spacers (ie a
  20mm spacer needs 28+20 = 48mm bolts). Stock wheel bolts are <b>Ball Seat</b>
  Meaning that they are somewhat rounded. Most aftermarket wheels use <b>Conical
    Seat</b> wheel bolts. You MUST use the correct type for your wheel or they will
back out..</p>
