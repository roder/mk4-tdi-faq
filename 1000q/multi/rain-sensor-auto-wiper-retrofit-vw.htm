<h2>This article shows how to add the rain sensor and auto dimming mirror for
auto headlights and wipers on a 2006 VW Jetta TDI.&nbsp; It will also work on mk5
and mk6 Golf, JSW, or Passat.</h2>

<p>
  The 2005.5 Jetta was the only mk5 TDI that   came with the
rain-light sensor.&nbsp; This feature was discontinued for 2006 and is currently
only available  on the 2012+ VW Passat and Touareg.&nbsp; Some non-TDI
models which also had sensors equipped were the Touareg, R32, GTI, and
Phaeton.&nbsp; It was available on Audi A3 TDI premium plus trim so you may be
able to retrofit it to a premium (base) trim Audi A3 TDI as well. </p>
<p>The article first shows installation on a mk5. Additional notes for 2010 and later cars are at the bottom.</p>
<p>All US 2012 VW Passat TDI come with a rain-light sensor standard. Base Canadian cars, 2.5L Passat, and 2013+ SE trim don't come with the auto dimming rear view mirror. You can use this article to retrofit it. The Passat system is the same except they use a newer style sensor than shown here.</p>

<p>
 Any car with a highline central electric control module (CECM)
should be compatible with a rain sensor but I don't know which rain sensor is
compatible with what control module.&nbsp; Generally speaking, the newer ones
are backwards compatible.&nbsp; If your control module long coding has a
checkbox for adding the rain sensor, it should work.&nbsp; See the bottom for
coding details.</p>

<p>
 Here is what the rain sensor
looks like on a factory install.&nbsp; I needed a new windshield (which
insurance paid for) and some styles of mk5 rain sensors are being discontinued from VW
so they were on sale for $9.&nbsp; I bought an auto dimming
mirror from a junkyard so the final price was about $160. Click to enlarge the pictures (most images on this page are thumbnails).<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/buyg/jetta-rain-sensor.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/buyg/tn/jetta-rain-sensor-tn.jpg" alt="vw rain light sensor" width="301" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/mirror-comparo.jpg" rel="lightbox-1"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/mirror-comparo-tn.jpg" alt="auto dimming vs. stock mirror" width="232" height="200"></a></p>

<p>The rain-light sensor controls the auto headlights and auto wipers.&nbsp; It
shines infrared light out and looks
for a reflection.&nbsp; Therefore, the sensor must have a clear view outside and
be mounted within the swept area of the wiper arms so that the glass over the sensor will be
cleaned.&nbsp; The mount for the sensor is also the mount for the OEM auto dimming rear view mirror.&nbsp; The
base of the auto-dimming and non-dimming mirror are completely different as seen
above.</p>
<p>The auto dimming mirror is a completely separate system
from the rain-light sensor, it's just that the OEM mirror's base
happens to be the sensor mount.&nbsp; The mirror will auto dim if you shift into
reverse and also has a button to disable auto-dimming.&nbsp; The auto dimming
has its own sensors which only dim the mirror - they do not control the auto
headlights.&nbsp; This is done with the rain-light sensor.&nbsp; The mirror
glass is about 3mm shorter and narrower than the non-dimming mirror.&nbsp; The
external dimensions are the same but the plastic edge is noticeably thicker in the dimming
mirror and it does look smaller when using it.</p>
<p>If you wish to add the OEM auto dimming mirror you must have the mount.&nbsp;
If you only want to add an an aftermarket auto dimming mirror, see this writeup: <a href="../a6/auto-dimming-mirror-vw-jetta-golf.htm">1000q:
auto dimming mirror retrofit</a>.&nbsp; The OEM mirror is made by Gentex which
also makes their own aftermarket mirrors to fit VW non-dimming
mounts. If you have a 2012+ Passat with the rain sensor, the OEM mirror should be an easy plug-play after you install the wiring.</p>
<p>If you only wish to add the rain-light sensor, you can stick it to the side of
the original mirror and just cover it with a piece of trim.&nbsp; Here is an example of only the rain sensor mounted to the side without the
OEM auto dimming mirror.&nbsp; jkmboler used a spring to hold the sensor tight
against the glass (normally the OEM mirror does this) and a plastic trim cover
from a Cadillac to make it look nice.&nbsp; The function is the same but you can
see the mount and glue from the outside of the
car.&nbsp; This area is normally covered with black paint.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-outside.jpg" rel="lightbox-2"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-outside-tn.jpg" alt="vw rain light sensor retrofit" width="488" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-cover.jpg" rel="lightbox-2"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-cover-tn.jpg" alt="golf rain light sensor retrofit" width="554" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Your central electric control module (CECM) must have the ability to
recognize the rain light sensor.&nbsp; This includes any highline
controller.&nbsp; These were found on any package 2 VW.&nbsp; You can verify that your
CECM has this ability by entering the long coding and seeing if the checkbox to
recognize the rain sensor is
there.&nbsp; If it's not, you need a new (used is fine) CECM.</p>
<p>The rain sensor also lets you enable the auto-close feature.&nbsp; This
  closes the sunroof and windows if the sensor detects rain or after 24
  hours.&nbsp; See this writeup for a demo and how to enable this: <a href="../a5/auto-close-windows-rain-sensor-vw.htm">1000q:
rain convenience feature</a>.</p>

<p>There's a black painted circle where the regular mirror mounts to the
windshield.&nbsp; Here are the locations of the original and rain sensor mount
bases.&nbsp; You can either buy a new rain sensor specific windshield from VW or
get aftermarket glass (they all come with a new mount already bonded) or remove your
original mount and glue on the rain sensor mount.&nbsp; If you have a mk6 Jetta,
none came with a rain sensor from the factory so you cannot order one.&nbsp;
2010+ Golf-Sportwagen didn't come with a rain sensor from the factory but you
can order one.&nbsp; The part number is listed below.&nbsp; If you find out if
the 2010+ Golf-Sportwagen windshields come with the mount already glued on,
please post a follow up in <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f9/how-add-rain-sensor-auto-headlights-wipers-auto-dimming-mirror-7354/">this
support thread in the myturbodiesel forums</a>.</p>

<p>This writeup also describes
how to add the sensor to
the non-rain sensor style windshields.&nbsp; Since the black painted circle (ceramic plate) will still be
on your original windshield, you can either mount it lower than the circle, to the side, or use a wire and heat gun to cut out the original base, then use a razor
and polish to remove the black ceramic paint.<br>

<p>The colors available for the rear view mirror and trim are anthracite (light black) and satin
  black (black black).&nbsp; Anthracite is slightly lighter, especially in bright
  light.&nbsp; The mirror, mirror base covers, and wiring covers are available
  with suffix 71n for anthracite.&nbsp; I ordered them with suffix 9b9 for satin black.&nbsp; See <a href="../VW-Audi-part-numbers-system-explained.htm">1000q:
    VW part numbers explained</a> on how to read the part numbers.&nbsp; Basically, you change the suffix if you want to change the
  color, if applicable.&nbsp; I ordered a beige headliner trim piece (7g8) and
  found that it was much darker than my headliner.&nbsp; It's barely visible
  from inside the car and it's under the dot matrix blackout area so it's not 
  visible from outside either.&nbsp; My correct color should have been pearl grey:
y20.&nbsp; It's also available with 9b9 or 71n.</p>
<p><strong>Parts for the VW Passat are the same except for the trim covers and sensor:</strong><br>
  The mirror is a different part number because it's two tone color.  The Jetta mirror will fit the mount (same) but I don't know if the trim covers will fit the mirror correctly. If you have a Jetta mirror you can use the Jetta trim but I don't know if the wire covers are long enough.</p>
<p> 3c0 857 304 TRIM (Headliner Connector) add y20 for pearl grey, 7g8 for beige<br>
3c0 857 511 d MIRROR (auto dimming) add sma for pearl grey, tlx for beige, tly for latte<br>
3c0 857 593 a 9b9 WIRING COVER black<br>
3c0 858 547 9b9 LEFT MIRROR COVER black<br>
3c0 858 548 9b9 RIGHT MIRROR COVER black<br>
The sensor part number is 1k0 955 559 with suffix af, ah, r, or m. Give your  VIN number when ordering to check for compatibility. af and ah are newer part versions - the intermittent wiper speed dial adjusts the sensor sensitivity effectively.<br>

<h3>Procedure to install a retrofit rain light sensor</h3>

<p>Both sensor and mirror installation are shown.&nbsp; If you only wish to add
the sensor, just follow those steps.&nbsp; You only need to add the wiring for
the sensor.</p>

<p>Remove the original rear view mirror by rotating the base a quarter turn
counter-clockwise.&nbsp; It's held by this clip.&nbsp; It will then easily come straight out.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/mirror.jpg" alt="vw mirror removal" width="557" height="350"></p>

<h4>If you didn't get a replacement windshield</h4>

<p>If you don't get a replacement windshield for rain sensor, remove the original mirror mount by heating the mount with a lighter and twisting it off. Do not push or pull it, just twist it with medium force using a wrench. Any more and it will crack the glass.&nbsp; Use a razor and scrape and then polish all the ceramic
backing paint
off.&nbsp; Then use 1000 grit wet sandpaper to gently remove the ceramic paint. If you don't remove that dot you'll have to mount the mirror too low
and there will be exposed wires. digitalextremes said it took him at least an hour to remove the paint. (click to enlarge the thumbnails) Then try to polish it as smooth as possible so that the glass has no noticeable scratches.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/windshield-1.jpg" rel="lightbox-w"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/windshield-1-tn.jpg" width="267" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/windshield-2.jpg" rel="lightbox-w"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/windshield-2-tn.jpg" width="267" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/windshield-3.jpg" rel="lightbox-w"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/windshield-3-tn.jpg" width="267" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/windshield-4.jpg" rel="lightbox-w"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/windshield-4-tn.jpg" width="267" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Here are some more tips by user whackit: Getting the dot off sucks. I used a 2" air grinder and it was still   pretty difficult. This is actually a baked on ceramic that is applied   when the glass is still red hot. I started with 320 grit and gradually   worked my way down to 1500. It still took 30 minutes with an air tool. The stuff you want to use to polish the glass is called Cerium Oxide. It   is what professionals use to polish glass. You can get it as a powder   or an impregnated disk at places like Mcmaster or Caswell. I like to use   the powder which you mix to a paste and then use a hard cotton bonnet   in a drill. Torque is more important than speed with this stuff so just   use a power drill and go at it. Be careful of heat. I built a masking   tape 'Dam' about a foot around the dot so any paste that was flung off   would not go all over the car. You should still cover everything up   though as inevitably it will go everywhere. This stuff will eliminate   ALL sanding scratches and leave you with a smooth finish. You will   notice there is a distortion from the application of the ceramic dot.   This is from the manufacturing process and didn't affect function. </p>
<p>Don't waste your money on the vw glues. they are just repackaged urethane glues made by other manufacturers. Do use 3m fast cure urethane and primer. The urethane glass glue is 8690   and the primer is 08682. You an get this stuff at most auto body   suppliers for about 20 bucks for both.The key to making this look OEM is   the 3m 08682 primer. This stuff is designed to black out in front of   urethanes to protect them from the sun.  I created a mask and daubed it   on to get a near perfect OEM look.  Attached is an image of the template   I used.  Just mark a center line on the outside of the windshield with a   sharpie (remove with solvent) and use the shorter of the two cable   covers attached to the mount to determine the spacing to the headliner.   Mark, mask, and paint.  The glue is very viscous and you can pretty much   just press the mount on and it will hold it until dry. I like to use   some tape for insurance though. Here is his template for painting the black rectangle: <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/90101-post73.html">http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/90101-post73.html</a><br>
</p>

<p>Clean the windshield with cleaner VW# d 009 401 04 (thumbnail below left) and let dry for at least
10 minutes.&nbsp; Apply primer VW# d 009 200 01 (shown below right) and let dry for at least 10
minutes and not more than 1 hour.&nbsp; Use 800-1200 grit sandpaper to roughen
the mount until water won't bead up or run off it.&nbsp; Use the cleaner on the
mount.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/d00940104.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/d00940104-tn.jpg" alt="d 009 401 04" width="141" height="219"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="../../images/a5/light/d00920002.jpg" alt="d 009 200 02" width="264" height="219"></p>

<p>Apply the new mount (VW# 1k0-845-543) to the windshield. The slide tracks for the new
mirror must face down (be on the lower half, visible in the pictures throughout
this page).&nbsp; The new auto dimming
mirror just slides up to install, down to remove.&nbsp; Apply a 2.5mm bead of
VW's 2 part polyurethane glue (shown earlier in parts) to the mount and tape it in place.&nbsp; After
  an hour, you can remove the tape and scrape/wipe any excess off.&nbsp; The
  service manual says that you can mount the new mirror after 2.5 hours but I
would wait at 8-12 hours to let the urethane glue cure.</p>
<p> Here are some notes by digitalextremes: When the 2 part glue is put on the mirror mount, I would highly recommend to leave it on the mount for a minute and then attached it to the windshield, I had created a mess by putting the mirror right on to the windshield after putting the glue on.</p>
<p>*Note - the service manual's instructions are for attaching the mirror to OEM
  glass with the black painted area.&nbsp; You might be OK using the cheap auto
  store rear mirror glue but I would use either the 3m glass urethane or VW's  2 part polyurethane.&nbsp;
  A professional
  windshield installer should also have an acceptable substitute.&nbsp; VW's windshield cleaner is
  just listed as an all purpose cleaner so you should be fine using water and paper
  towels as long as any grease or glue is removed.&nbsp; I don't know what's in
  VW's primer is but most people don't use it.&nbsp; Also, the
  OEM glass has a painted area to hide the bead of glue and match the edge of the mirror base cover.&nbsp; If you use VW's
  glue, I would tape off a neat square around the mount and use a thicker
  bead.&nbsp; This way, the edges will be sharp.&nbsp; Once the glue is tacky you
  can remove the tape and clean the edges.&nbsp; This should make the edges are clean as possible and make it appear acceptable from
outside the car. Use an exacto knife for any final detail. If it still looks bad I suggest  sticking a &quot;No Fear&quot; windshield banner over it and cutting a hole in the middle so the sensor can still see out. At this point it's already glued on.</p>

<h4>Procedure continued</h4>

<p>Remove the overhead console.&nbsp; First gently pry the sunglasses holder
out.&nbsp; There are some clips at the top holding it.&nbsp; The middle panel
will just pop out.&nbsp; Remove the 2x T20 screws under it.</p>

<p> Then unclip
the blue plug (overhead lighting) and the sunroof dial plug (pulls straight
out).&nbsp; Then remove the 2x T20 screws in the front and 2x phillips screws in
the rear, shown below right.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/sunglass.jpg" rel="lightbox-3"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/sunglass-tn.jpg" alt="jetta overhead console removal" width="166" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/overhead.jpg" rel="lightbox-3"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light//tn/overhead-tn.jpg" alt="golf overhead console" width="146" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Loosen the headliner by removing the sunvisors and front grab handles.&nbsp;
This makes it much easier to route the wiring.&nbsp; Use a pick to pop their
covers off and remove the T20 screws holding them.&nbsp; If you choose to
not loosen the headliner, use a wire snake (a bent coathanger) to push the
wiring through.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/sunvisor.jpg" rel="lightbox-4"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/sunvisor-tn.jpg" alt="vw sunvisor removal" width="730" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/grab.jpg" rel="lightbox-4"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/grab-tn.jpg" width="374" height="200"></a></p>
<p>NOTE: The sunvisor and grab handle brackets  they're screwed into can move around. During installation, gently push up to get into the threads. You're supposed to replace them each time they're tightened because they deform and lock down. The anchor might slide out the side if it's allowed to go diagonal and it's gone and rattling until you remove the headliner. If that happens you won't be able to tighten the bolt since there's no anchor for it to screw into. Here's a picture of a used one and new one. When the bolt is tightened the anchor is pulled down and smushes the sides out to lock the bracket in place. Below right is another picture of the grab handle with the headliner removed showing how the anchors sit.<br>
<img src="../../images/a5/body/1k0-867-633.jpg" width="623" height="300"> <a href="../../images/a5/body/grab-handle.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="../../images/a5/body/grab-handle-tn.jpg" width="600" height="300"></a></p>
<p><a href="../../images/a5/light/grab.jpg"></a>Insert a screwdriver or your key in the slot on the fusebox cover and pop it
off. Remove the trim strip shown below.&nbsp; Press the door seal back a little and gently
  pull to release the clip at the
  top.&nbsp; Lift it up and out.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/a-pillar2.jpg" alt="trim removal jetta" width="563" height="450"></p>

<p>Use a sharp pick to dig under and pop out the driver's side airbag logo on the a-pillar (windshield
  pillar).&nbsp; Remove the T25 torx bolt underneath it and peel the door seal
  back slightly.&nbsp; Then gently wiggle-pull the trim up and out.&nbsp; There
  are some white plugs that hold the trim to the pillar.&nbsp; If you're careful
  they shouldn't break but will probably still be in the pillar after you remove
  the trim.&nbsp; You could use a wire snake to pull the wiring through the pillar
  but I was more comfortable taping the wiring away from the head
  curtain airbag with the rest of the wiring.&nbsp; See the TOS Agreement for the full legal disclaimer.&nbsp;
  Be careful when working around the airbag. Here is an empty slot, one with trim snap plug in place, and one with a plug
  next to it.&nbsp; You only need to remove the driver's side.&nbsp; I removed
  both sides so that they wouldn't get dirty during windshield replacement.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/a-pillar.jpg" rel="lightbox-5"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/a-pillar-tn.jpg" alt="side trim removal vw" width="482" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/a-pillar3.jpg" rel="lightbox-5"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/a-pillar3-tn.jpg" alt="windshield trim vw" width="505" height="200"></a></p>

<p><a href="../../images/a5/light/a-pillar3.jpg"></a>If you're installing the OEM mirror, cut a hole in the center of the
headliner to pass the wires through.&nbsp; It will be covered by the headliner trim piece 1k5857304r.&nbsp;
Make sure it's centered behind the mount. If you're just installing the sensor, the wires can fit through the headliner
gap.  Here is a new headliner showing the other side and what shape to cut it. (One of my beige side clips was broken). Just cut a hole for the trim clips and the black wiring cover, no need to snip the very top (more pics below).<br>
<img src="../../images/a5/light/headliner-hole.jpg" width="600" height="422"></p>
<h3>Wiring instructions for auto dimming mirror and rain light sensor</h3>

<p>The easy way to do the wiring is to buy a premade harness from kufatec.&nbsp;
For some reason, they only list it under Golf and not Jetta but it will work on
both models.&nbsp; One person complained that the plug ends were at
equal lengths and because the sensor and mirror are staggered, he had to unwrap
and re-wrap it for fitment.&nbsp; A better harness with all the terminal ends can also be purchsed <a href="http://vagpartsforsale.blogspot.com/2011/06/for-sale-rain-light-sensor-anti-dazzle.html" target="_blank">from maloosheck</a>. Since it's only a few wires, I chose to buy some plugs, VW repair
wires (part numbers are noted above) and then splice 18 or 19 gauge extension wires
onto the repair wire ends to make my own harness.<br>

<p>Note 1: the auto dimming mirror controls the &quot;anti-dazzle&quot; auto dimming side
view mirrors.&nbsp; This wasn't equipped on North American cars and if you choose to add them the instructions are below in <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f7/adding-exterior-auto-dimming-mirrors-19093/">this post in the forum from dsg td</a>i. You will need 2 wires,  new side view
mirrors,  and a few plugs.&nbsp; As of this writing, each
auto dimming side view mirror glass is around $400 new and can only be found used from Europe.&nbsp;
If you want to add them, pin 4 and 5 on the mirror go to pin 2 and 3 on the 28
pin passenger door connector.</p>
<p><strong>Adding the auto dimming side view mirrors.</strong> (optional but expensive)</p>
<p>If you’re thinking about installing exterior auto-dimming mirrors you need to have or install an interior auto-dimming mirror. Supposedly 5.5 TDIs are pre-wired from the factory installed auto-dimming mirror to the door controllers, yours should have it pre-wired from the driver’s A pillar to the door controller. The easy way to check is to take of the door connector and see if there are wires in pins 2 and 3, these should go to the door controller pins 1 and 10. That’s it from the factory the rest you have to install yourself.</p>
<p>OK, you’ve decided that you want to do this – last chance to back out. Let’s assume that you either have or are installing an interior auto-dimming mirror, from pins 4 and 5 you need to check to see if your interior mirror is sending a signal out (some supposedly don’t have this function) check it with a multi-meter for change in resistance while you shine a light at your interior mirror. If it changes you are good to go, if not you need another interior mirror that will output this signal. Next you should have or need to install wires from pins 4 and 5 on the mirror connector to pins 2 and 3 of both front door interior connectors, now do the same for pins 2 and 3 on the passenger side exterior door connector on the A pillar, driver’s side should already have wires on pins 2 and 3.</p>
<p>On the passenger’s side you will need to remove both the door card and exterior door skin. Run the wires you installed in pins 2 and 3 through the rubber sleeve between the door and A pillar and follow the factory wiring harness to the door skin side and back through the rubber connector to the door card side and to pins 1 and 10 of the door controller plug. If your driver’s side wasn’t pre-wired, repeat for that side.</p>
<p>Now for the mirrors, you will need to add the auto-dimming plugs to each mirror pins 1 and 2 and from there to the mirror plug on the door controller pins 8 and 16</p>
<p>Wiring is as follows from the mirror plug 1 to mirror plug at door controller 16, from mirror plug 2 to mirror plug at door controller 8<br>
  From door controller plug 10 to door connector on A pillar pin 3, from door controller plug 1 to door connector on A pillar pin 2<br>
  From door connector on A pillar pin 2 to mirror connector pin 4, from door connector on A pillar pin 3 to mirror connector pin 5 – for both doors</p>
<p>If you prefer you can bypass the door controller completely and wire directly to the mirror wires, as the door controller is only a junction point and has no effect on the operation of the mirror</p>

<p><strong>Procedure continued</strong></p>
<p>The base of the auto dimming mirror, its plug, and rain light sensor plug
  have numbers identifying the pins.&nbsp; To wire the rain light sensor plug, just insert the repair wires (the ones
  that you had 2 of) until the hooks click.&nbsp; Give them a gentle tug to make
  sure they're hooked.&nbsp; Then push down the flap to lock the pins in place.&nbsp;
  Although you only ordered 2 repair wires in this size, cut the wire in
  half and you now have 4 ends.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls.jpg" rel="lightbox-6"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-tn.jpg" alt="auto dimming mirror vw" width="446" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-wire-1.jpg" rel="lightbox-6"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-wire-1-tn.jpg" alt="wire harness rain sensor" width="493" height="200"></a></p>

<p><br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-wire-1.jpg"></a>The auto dimming mirror plug comes with pins already installed so remove them and insert your repair wires (they already have pins on the ends).&nbsp; Press
the hooks on the original pins to pull them out.  Push the repair wire pins in until they click and give them a tug to make sure
they're hooked.&nbsp; The second part of the plug slides over it and locks the
pins in place.&nbsp; You may want to leave the plugs unlocked for now so that
you can test wire continuity later.&nbsp; If you need to unlock the plugs, use a
pick to pry them open.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/rls-wire-2.jpg" alt="diy sensor harness vw" width="929" height="359"></p>
<p>Run the wiring from the rain sensor and mirror behind the headliner, down the
  a-pillar, tape it to the existing wiring, and down to the CECM (central electric control module)
for the fusebox and ground.</p>

<p>Remove the 2x T20 screws holding the kick panel under the relay box.&nbsp;
Then unplug the footwell light and separate the OBD2 port from the panel. Push the red lever on the CECM to the side to unlock the plugs.&nbsp; The
plugs are labeled.&nbsp; Press the release clip on plug B and F and pull them
out.&nbsp; You can remove a few others for access.&nbsp; The wiring is pretty
short and the plugs are different so I don't think you could mix them up.&nbsp;
Plug B is outlined below.&nbsp; You can see the red lever to the right of the
relay box.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/panel.jpg" rel="lightbox-7"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/panel-tn.jpg" alt="trim removal vw" width="291" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/cecm-1.jpg" rel="lightbox-7"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/cecm-1-tn.jpg" alt="jetta cecm" width="267" height="200"></a></p>

<p>  The plugs also have numbered pins.&nbsp; Solder in a splice on Plug F, Pin 3
(violet/blue wire as noted above, this wire also goes to the windshield
wiper module) and run that wire up the A-pillar and
headliner to the repair wire on pin 3 of the rain-light sensor.&nbsp; Cut the
wiring to fit and solder them together.&nbsp; Splicing means that you tap into the connection and add your
own wire.&nbsp; I chose to strip a little bit of insulation off that wire and
soldered in the tap wire at that spot.&nbsp; Cover with electrical tape.&nbsp;
To connect the repair wire ends to my own extension wire, I used heat shrink crimps.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/crimp.jpg" alt="crimp wire" width="370" height="300"></p>
<p>Repeat for Plug B, Pin 1 (black/blue wire).&nbsp; This is for the backup
  light.&nbsp; It goes to pin 3 on the mirror.&nbsp; Sorry for the lack of pics
here but all you would see is a jumble of wires.</p>

<p>Install 2 new circuits for the rain sensor and mirror at the fusebox.&nbsp;
See the wiring diagram above and <a href="fusebox-add-circuit.htm">1000q:
how to add circuits to the fusebox</a>.&nbsp; Repair wire VW# 000 979 225 should
work but I'm not sure of the correct part number for wiring these two circuits.&nbsp; Please <a href="../../forum/index.php">post
in the forum</a> if you order this part so you can confirm it or show it's the
wrong part number.</p>

<p>Cut the repair wire in half.&nbsp; Insert the terminal ends in the indicated slots.&nbsp;
I think the mirror fuse (#7) could
go on any slot on that bus.&nbsp; #11 should be acceptable and easier to install
since it's on the near side of the fusebox, just make a note on the fusebox
cover if you do that.&nbsp; It gets 12V when the engine is running only.&nbsp; I
believe the bus for the RLS fuse always has 12V.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/rls-fuse.jpg" alt="vw jetta fusebox" width="449" height="600"></p>

<p> Run the wiring from the CECM along the existing wiring harness in the pillar
and then under the headliner to the overhead console.&nbsp; Make sure that the
wiring won't get pinched when you reinstall the trim.&nbsp; I ran it behind the
black plastic piece (white arrow), up the a-pillar, and under the headliner.&nbsp; Tape it away from any airbags so it won't interfere with their proper operation!<br>
<a href="../../images/misc/dashcam-install-5.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="../../images/misc/tn/dashcam-install-5-tn.jpg" width="325" height="200" border="0"></a></p>
<p>For ground, I soldered together
  the ground wires for the rain sensor and mirror
  and ran a single thicker wire back to the fusebox area.&nbsp; I stuck the ground
  wire under the 13mm nut for the dashboard support (yellow arrow).&nbsp; Yes it's not pretty but I'll never see it again and it's bare metal. If you
  dig a little more there are some grounds under the overhead lights (next few pics) but make sure it's not on paint or else it won't be a good ground.<br>
  <a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-wiring.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-wiring-tn.jpg" alt="rain light sensor retrofit" width="204" height="200"></a></p>
<p> Pin 6 on the mirror goes to pin 6 on the overhead lighting's blue
  plug.&nbsp; This prevents dimming when the light is on.&nbsp; There's a small
  tab on the side.&nbsp; Lift it and the cover slides off to the side.&nbsp; Use the remaining
  small repair wire end (the one that you ordered 2 of) and plug it into pin 6 as
  shown below right.&nbsp; Solder it to the repair wire end for pin 6 on the
mirror.</p>

<p>At first, I used splice-crimps for the sensor and mirror to the brown wire (ground for the overhead
lighting).&nbsp; It didn't have a good connection so I
ended up running ground down to the fusebox area as shown earlier.&nbsp; If the
sensor or mirror aren't working, double check the grounds and connections.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/rls-wiring-2.jpg" alt="overhead lighting plug vw" width="784" height="500"></p>
<p>Here is a wider shot<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/overhead-2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/overhead-2-tn.jpg" width="158" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Here is the ground from a Passat, the Jetta should be the same.<br>
<img src="../../images/a5/light/passat-ground.jpg" width="997" height="400" alt="passat auto headlight wiper"></p>

<p> Pass the wiring through the headliner trim.&nbsp; The mirror wire should
longer.&nbsp; In this example, the wiring was pretty tight so you may want to
leave them about 0.7-1.0 cm longer than shown and stuff any excess under the
headliner.&nbsp; You can also see the difference in color between the beige trim
and pearl grey headliner. After installation I never looked at it again so the color difference isn't really noticeable.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-wiring-3.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-wiring-3-tn.jpg" alt="vw rain sensor windshield mount" width="304" height="200"></a></p>

<p>When installing the sensor on the mirror, make sure the jelly pad is
clean.&nbsp; There should be no air pockets between the sensor and
windshield.&nbsp; For some reason, all of the sensors I've seen with this part
number (version r) have two gaps at the bottom.&nbsp; Once you install it, the
gaps disappear.&nbsp; There are a few versions which will work on different
platforms so check part compatibility before using any random VW-Audi light
sensor.</p>

<p> The plug goes at the top and the rear view mirror has some springs
which hold the sensor against the glass.&nbsp; The two wire covers snap together
and also help hold the sensor and headliner trim cover in place.&nbsp; The
headliner trim was loose against the hole I cut earlier, so don't worry if it's
not a perfect fit until now.&nbsp; I found that sitting in the driver's seat
backwards with my back against the steering wheel was the most comfortable way
to sit while cutting the hole.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-trim.jpg" rel="lightbox-8"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-trim-tn.jpg" alt="vw auto wiper sensor" width="298" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/rain-light-sensor-vw.jpg" rel="lightbox-8"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rain-light-sensor-vw-tn.jpg" alt="rls vw" width="226" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Slide the new mirror up on the mount rails until the stop.&nbsp; Plug in the
wires and snap the trim covers on.&nbsp; Reconnect the battery and headlight switch.&nbsp;
You can leave the covers off if you wish to test the sensors first.&nbsp; Note
that the black painted area matches the edge of the mirror base trim.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-trim-2.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-trim-2-tn.jpg" alt="jetta wiper headlight sensor" width="442" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Here is how the mk5 Passat mirror looks. The trim doesn't match up because in this case, the mount was glued below the original spot. Also shown is the headliner trim on the Passat. The hole on the trim covers should match up against this and help hold it in place.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/passat-mirror.jpg" rel="lightbox-9"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/passat-mirror-tn.jpg" alt="vw passat auto dimming mirror wiper" width="473" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/passat-trim.jpg" rel="lightbox-9"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/passat-trim-tn.jpg" alt="vw passat auto wiper" width="267" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Here is another picture from user amd is the best with the windshield removed and what it looked like after installation.<br>

<p>Plug in VCDS and look for the green LED.&nbsp; Start the software and select
  the control modules.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/vcds-main-screen.png" width="631" height="453"></p>

<p>Select 09-Central Electric.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/cecm.png" width="637" height="462" alt="vw cecm coding"></p>

<p>Click on coding and you will see this.&nbsp; Click on long coding helper.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/jetta-cecm.png" width="623" height="306" alt="rain light sensor coding"></p>

<p> Click on Bit 6,
Rain/Light sensor installed.&nbsp; Close the window and you will see a New
Coding in the blank spot in the above screenshot.&nbsp; Click Do it! to save.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/cecm-1.png" width="716" height="304" alt="rain light sensor activation"></p>

<p>The rain sensor should now work!&nbsp; The intermittent position on the
wiper stalk is now auto-sense.&nbsp; The dial which used to be intermittent
wiper speed is now sensor sensitivity.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wish to enable rain
closing, see <a href="../a5/auto-close-windows-rain-sensor-vw.htm">1000q: rain closing
function</a>.&nbsp; If you do, you'll see this option on the convenience menu.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/rls-menu.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/light/tn/rls-menu-tn.jpg" alt="vw auto wiper menu" width="526" height="200"></a></p>

<p>Because you disconnected the battery, the steering assist and ESP are reset and will
show the above lights.&nbsp; This should be resolved through regular
driving.&nbsp; You also need to reset the one touch windows by raising and then
pressing up again, then lowering, and pressing down again.&nbsp; If you have
power seats, do the same thing with the range of motion to reset the
memory.&nbsp; If there is a problem, see <a href="../a5/steering-adaptation-VW.htm">1000q:
steering wheel adaptation reset</a>.</p>

<p> To enable auto lights, you must
install a new headlight switch with an Auto position.&nbsp; Also enable Bit 7 in
the screenshot above, Coming-Home active.&nbsp; This leaves the headlights on
when you lock the car.</p>

<p>Test the mirror by covering the front sensor to dim it.&nbsp; The mirror should work if the engine is
running and the button on the bottom is pressed in.&nbsp; When you shift into reverse, it should
go out of dim.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/3LjwblVtIME?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Reinstall the trim.&nbsp; When installing the a-pillar trim, look at the
plastic snaps through the windshield to make sure they're aligned.&nbsp; It also
has a metal clip at the bottom.&nbsp; I suggest installing the bottom with the
clip first.</p>

<h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

<p>First double check the wires, pin, and grounds.&nbsp; You can use a
multimeter to check wire continuity.&nbsp; The rain sensor needs
power, ground, and a communication wire to the CECM to function (in addition to
coding).&nbsp; The mirror doesn't have any communication, it only needs power
and ground to function at a basic level.&nbsp; I think that if you have rain closing on, the rain sensor is always
powered until 24 hours of being locked. After 24 hours, the sensor will close the windows+roof on a locked car. I believe this is to prevent  drain. The mirror is powered only when the engine is running.</p>

<p>You can verify the rain and light sensor function.&nbsp; From the CECM
screen, click on measuring blocks.&nbsp; Go to Group 8 (below left).&nbsp; Block 1 and 2 show
function of the sensor. If you're having a problem with the backup lights, you probably cut the Plug
B, pin 1 wire on the CECM when installing the mirror.&nbsp; It can be checked
through group 6 (below right).<br>

<h3>mk6 VW Golf, Jetta (2010 and later), and Passat rain light sensor (RLS) installation notes</h3>
<p>There were no North American mk6 Golf or Jetta that came with the rain sensor from the factory although it was optional in Europe. The Sportwagen has a part number for the rain sensor windshield listed below. The Golf also has a windshield part number but the parts catalog makes me suspect that it does not come with the mount already glued on. You may have to buy the mount and glue it on yourself. The differences is the black ceramic painted area and dot matrix. The Jetta has no part number that you can order in the US so you have to DIY. Forget about special ordering it because it's much cheaper to ship a small box of  glass crumbs than a big box.</p>
<p>2010+ Sportwagen (Golf wagon) windshield with sensor mount: 1k5 845 011 bc (1k5845011bc)<br>
  2010+ Golf windshield with sensor mount: 5k9 845 911 k (5k9845911k), this may
not include the mount (listed below) already attached</p>
<p>Compatible rain-light sensors: 1k0 955 559 r = works on 2010 GTI.  1k0 955 559 ah = should work on most mk6 and all mk5. Again, you must have a highline CECM for this to work.</p>
<p>The electronics were overhauled for 2010 so the CECM looks completely different. Your CECM should have only 3 plugs: A (black plug), B (white plug), and C (tan plug). So instead of tapping plug F, pin 3 like the old modules for the rain light sensor communication wire, you tap the white plug, pin 33. This is a violet/white stripe wire.</p>
<p>In the wire diagram below, &quot;Black plug A&quot; is M. &quot;White plug B&quot; is N. &quot;Tan plug C&quot; is P.</p>
<p><a href="../../images/a5/light/mk6-rls.png" rel="lightbox"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/mk6-rls-tn.png" width="253" height="200"></a></p>
<p>Verify function through VCDS, CECM measuring blocks. You can use a flashlight (or cover) and water to test the sensor.<br>
<img src="../../images/a5/light/mk6-rls-2.png" width="638" height="459"><img src="../../images/a5/light/mk6-rls-3.png" width="636" height="461"></p>
<p>smrtypants44 found that the Auto function would not work until he changed the assistance driving light acitvation delay from 6 to 0 seconds. This is through the central electric adaptation, channel 30 as seen below.<br>
<img src="../../images/a5/light/mk6-auto.png" width="608" height="324"></p>
<p>Here is the fusebox on a 2010 Jetta TDI (click to enlarge) with some notes by digitalextremes: fuse #7 had no power and #17 was taken by J393 - Comfort System Central Control Module, J641 - Alarm Horn Relay. I didn't bother connecting PIN 3 from the mirror to CECM, I did run the wire up to the CECM but connect it some other time, I believe the PIN location on the CECM for the backup lights are: M28 (left backup) and P28 (right backup) (A28 and C28), so you can tap either I am assuming. I couldn't find any grounds up in the headliner so I ran all 5 wires to the fusebox/cecm area: 2 Powers, 2 for CECM and 1 common ground for both sensor and mirror. I connected the ground with a ring connector I got for Canadian Tire and connected it on the top bolt that holds that fusebox. I used the vw cloth tape to cover all 5 wires from end-end to make it a harness. In his case, he had to turn the assistance driving light on instead of turning the delay from 6 to 0 as smrtypants44 did. This could be a difference in the Golf vs. Jetta.<br>
<a href="../../images/a5/light/2010-jetta-fusebox-1.jpg" rel="lightbox-f"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/2010-jetta-fusebox-1-tn.jpg" width="176" height="200"></a><a href="../../images/a5/light/2010-jetta-fusebox-2.jpg" rel="lightbox-f"><img src="../../images/a5/light/tn/2010-jetta-fusebox-2-tn.jpg" width="150" height="200"></a></p>
<p>If you have a mk6 Passat without the auto dimming rear view mirror, you just have to add the wiring for the mirror and plug it in as shown above. The mount should be the same.<br>
