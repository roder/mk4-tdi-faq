<h2>A clay bar cleaning on your VW can remove contaminants
stuck in the paint.</h2>
<p>Run your hand over your car's paint immediately after washing it.&nbsp; Is it
rough or smooth as glass?&nbsp; If it's not smooth as glass, you would benefit
from a clay bar treatment.&nbsp; It will improve the look and
smoothness of the paint.&nbsp; Instead of coating over impurities stuck in the
paint like wax does, a clay bar actually pulls them out.&nbsp; No amount of
washing will clean these particles because they are stuck in the paint.&nbsp; If
you have ever waxed your car by hand, you will notice that afterwards, the
towels and pads have lots of black dirt even though you just washed
the car.&nbsp; Modern waxes contain slight amounts of polish and managed to pull
out <i>some</i> of the dirt that you just waxed and sealed over.&nbsp; For a daily driven car, I
recommend using a clay bar once every year or two.&nbsp; If you just bought a
car, a clay bar treatment will really help the paint shine.</p>
<p>After you use a clay bar, I suggest following it up with a  porter cable polisher
and <a href="how-to-polish-paint-porter-cable.htm">polishing the paint</a>, since clay only pulls
out dirt - it does not remove scratches.&nbsp; Then wax your car because the clay removed the wax.</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p> First, thoroughly wash the
entire car.&nbsp; Refer to the article: <a href="washwax.htm">washing
and waxing your car for more tips on car washing</a> .&nbsp; As always, stay out of direct sunlight.&nbsp; There's no need
to dry the car because you want it wet for the clay bar.</p>
<p>Depending on the clay bar you have, it may come with a spray bottle
of lubricant.&nbsp; You can also use a fresh bucket of clean soap and
water.&nbsp; It is very important not to be stingy with the lubricant or water
because it lets the clay glide over the paint and pull out any
contaminants.&nbsp; If you don't wash the car before you clay or don't use
enough lubricant, it will scratch your paint, so use plenty of
lubricant!&nbsp; Never use just water as a lubricant.</p>
<p>Move the clay in a back and forth motion over a small section section.&nbsp; When you begin, you may feel a scratching, bumpy feeling -
this is normal.&nbsp; Keep it wet when moving over a new section.&nbsp; After a few swipes,
the passes will
smooth out and will start to have no resistance - this means that you have removed
all the contaminants from the paint!&nbsp; Feel the paint with your hand and it should
be as smooth as glass.&nbsp; Before moving onto the next section, wipe the
surface of the clay to remove any big dirt particles and then fold the clay in
half to expose a fresh cleaning surface. I suggest starting at the roof and moving down, claying the section behind
the wheels last, as this is the dirtiest section.&nbsp;</p>
<p> I recommend using clay only by hand because it lets
you feel and control the application.&nbsp; Any machine could increase the likelihood
of scratches and you won't know when the paint has been sufficiently cleaned due
to lack of feel.&nbsp;&nbsp;This whole thing is pretty self explanatory, but
here is a picture anyways.&nbsp; Just keep the surface very wet, move in the
direction of the arrows, and you will be fine.</p>

<p>After finishing each small area, look at the clay's surface.&nbsp; If it looks dirty
(which it will) or has large
particles stuck in it, pick them out and fold the
clay to get a fresh cleaning surface and continue.&nbsp; You can also feel how bumpy the
gliding is - lots of bumps mean lots of contaminants. If it feels really rough, clean and fold the clay
more often to keep the cleaning surface fresh.&nbsp; If you drop the clay onto the
ground, throw it out
or cut off the entire outside surface.&nbsp; The clay will have
tiny bits of dirt and sand too small to notice stuck to it and it will scratch the
paint.&nbsp; Because of this, I normally cut the clay bar in half to extend each
half's life.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>After you're done, you can wash and dry the car again or <a href="how-to-polish-paint-porter-cable.htm">polish the paint as
described in the polishing paint article</a>, depending on how much clay or dirt
is on it.</p>

<p>But wait there's more!&nbsp; Save your old clay and you can use it to remove
the flecks of dried stuff on the wheels or
rock guard.&nbsp; It could be road tar or baked on brake dust.&nbsp; You can use
your old clay to clean these surfaces as long as the clay does not contain large
bits of sand, etc.</p>
