<h1>How to roll the fenders for larger wheels and tires</h1>
<p>
<a href="difficulty_scale.htm">Difficulty level: 2/5</a></p>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p>If your tires rub against the fender inner lip due to lowering or sagging
suspension, larger wheels, or excessive wheel offset, you can try rolling out
the fender lip to help reduce or eliminate tire rubbing.&nbsp; Keep in mind that
larger wheels and tires normally result in reduced handling, comfort, and fuel
economy!&nbsp; Especially for daily driver cars, you want to stay within a
certain wheel size.&nbsp; See <a href="../wheels/oem-vw-audi-wheels-gallery-database.htm">1000q:
wheel overview</a> for more details.&nbsp;</p>
Rolling the fender means to bend the inner lip of the fender to form a tighter angle than
stock.&nbsp; This gives more clearance on the inside of the fender lip, it won't
do anything to the outside of the fender.&nbsp; First make sure that you identify the spots
where it is
rubbing.&nbsp; Note that fender rolling only eliminates minor rubbing.&nbsp; If
the tire is actually cut or the rubbing is against the suspension, you have a
much bigger problem that cannot be fixed by rolling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>Now, you may be asking yourself why the car maker didn't roll the fenders to begin
with.&nbsp; That lip is there to add structural integrity.&nbsp; Which is
stiffer when pressing on the top: a metal soda can or an equally thin piece of
sheet metal.&nbsp; Try denting the soda can on it's side and you can crush it
easily. The fender lip adds strength to the fender, so do this modification at
your own risk!</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>
<p>Some people
have used a baseball bat, jacked up the car, lowered it so that the baseball bat
pinches the bat, and roll/lever it against the tire to bend back the
fender.&nbsp; This is dangerous and may produce uneven results.&nbsp; Since
there are tools available from the eastwood
company, various rental places, etc, I would use fender rolling tools instead of
a baseball bat. &nbsp; A professional body shop will also be
able to roll the fenders.&nbsp; Below is a picture of a fender roller.<br>

just bolt the roller to the hub and move the roller slowly forward to bend the
lip.&nbsp;<p>Before rolling, make sure the paint is heated.&nbsp; It may crack if it's
too cold and hard.&nbsp; A hair dryer will help, but a heat gun is best.
<p>Remove the fender liners as necessary, etc.</p>
<p>Attach the fender roller to the hub and just roll in short back and
forth motions.&nbsp; You don't want to make big or fast motions since this can
crack the paint.&nbsp; Again, make sure the paint stays warm to reduce the
chance of the paint cracking.</p>
