<h2>This article shows how to DIY glow plug removal and replacement on a VW
TDI  or Audi TDI engine.</h2>
<p>If
you want to do compression testing, glow plug replacement, etc.,&nbsp;the glow
plugs need
to come out.&nbsp; If you think that you need new glow plugs, first check the
wiring as faulty or corroded wiring may cause a misdiagnosis.&nbsp; Glow plug
relay is a common misdiagnosis, while you you should still check the glow plug
relay, get the car scanned for codes first.&nbsp; One trick is to unplug the
coolant temperature sensor coming off the cylinder head coolant flange to trick
the computer into thinking it's cold and turning on the glow plugs to their
maximum glow duration.</p>
<p>The glow plugs are only used before engine start when it's
  cold.&nbsp; They are on after every engine start to help emissions and smooth
  running until around 2500 rpm.</p>
<p>Glow plugs are not a &quot;it works or it doesn't&quot; item.&nbsp;&nbsp; As glow plugs
  age and are used,
  they become weaker and could contribute to a hard start condition.&nbsp;
  You can extend the glow plug duration through a VCDS cable. Manual transmission cars use 3 coolant glow plugs in the coolant
  flange out of the head for faster engine warm-up, they are not the same as the
  engine glow plugs.&nbsp; In an automatic transmission
  car, the ATF fluid cooler accomplishes this so there are no coolant glow plugs.</p>
<p>2004-2006 TDI use
  ceramic glow plugs and light up faster but are more fragile.&nbsp; The Bosch
  ceramic glow plugs were replaced with steel plugs under an emissions recall but
  caused cold starting problems.&nbsp; At the end of 2010 VW extended the warranty
  on vehicles that had the recall done and reflashed these cars and replaced the
  Bosch with NGK ceramic glow plugs.&nbsp; They cannot be swapped with steel
  without a computer change because of differnet voltages and duration.&nbsp; See <a href="../glow-plug-recall-PD-TDI.htm">1000q:
cold start PD engines due to glow plugs</a> for more details on this.</p>
<p>2009 and 2010 TDI use pressure
  sensing glow plugs in their common rail engine and it's not a simple remove-replace.</p>
<p>TDI up to about 2002 sense all glow plugs as 1 unit because of
  the wiring harness.&nbsp; TDI after about 2002 can sense each glow plug
  separately on the harness.&nbsp; The glow plugs are numbered opposite the engine
  cylinders.&nbsp; #1 cylinder has #4 glow plug.&nbsp; #2 cylinder has #3 glow
  plug, etc.&nbsp; From what I've heard, this is because of a European wiring
  standard where #1 glow plug (which happens to be cylinder #4) is closest to the
  12v feed wire.</p>
<p>Don't mix/match brands of glow plugs.&nbsp; Buy all bosch or all
  beru glow plugs. Below is a .pdf file with some technical info on glow plugs.</p>

<h3>VW and Audi tDI glow plug removal procedure</h3>
<p>Remove the engine cover (3x 10mm nuts).&nbsp; Then remove the glow plug wires.&nbsp; Gently wiggle and
  pry them straight out.&nbsp; If you must, you can remove a fuel injector hard
  line to get more clearance.&nbsp; Just be prepared to catch any leaked fuel with a
  towel.&nbsp; Make sure there is plenty of ventilation, no source of ignition or
  spark nearby, and that fuel vapors are fully evacuated before working on the
  car.</p>
<p>If you're not sure which are the glow plugs, here is a picture
  with the glow plug wire harness removed and #4 and #3 glow plug.&nbsp; They are
  numbered opposite the engine cylinders because of how far each one is from the bus.<br>

<p>Before you remove the glow plugs, clean the area around the glow plugs.&nbsp; Use
  carb/brake cleaner and lightly
  spray/wipe the area around the plug.&nbsp; Then use
  compressed air to blow out the area.&nbsp; Make sure you are wearing safety
  goggles because compressed air will send dirt into the air.&nbsp; If there's a
  lot of corrosion, spray
  a drop of PB blaster around the threads and let soak.&nbsp; This will
  loosen the threads and make it easier to remove.&nbsp; Wipe away any excess
  penetrating lubricant.</p>
<p>Use a deep 10mm socket and universal joints to remove the glow
  plugs or VW special tool 3220.</p>
<p>Warning: the glow plugs can break off if they are over torqued
  during installation or removal!&nbsp; They could break at as low as 26 ft-lb
  which isn't a lot so if they're too tight, let the engine warm up a little and
  use more penetrating lubricant.</p>
<p>Put a tiny dab of antiseize around the glow plug threads and replace.&nbsp;
  Less is better, too much can get squished into the cylinder.&nbsp; Wd-40
  or other lubricants are not a substitute for anti-seize.</p>
<p>
  Beware of parallax, a viewing error, when rethreading the glow plugs!&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Please read <a href="auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
    mechanics tips and garage organization</a>  for more information on
  this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The glow plug threads are not perpendicular to the head!&nbsp;
  Each is at a slightly different angle.&nbsp; If the threads don't go in smoothly for at least a few turns, you may
  be stripping the threads.&nbsp; One trick is to turn the plug counterclockwise for a complete
  turn to feel the threads,&nbsp; then turn
  clockwise to tighten once you've engaged the threads.&nbsp; The head is aluminum, so don't over torque it!&nbsp;
  Torque to only 10-12 ft lbs.</p>
<p>Here are some TDI glow plugs after removal. The black and white coloration on the tip is normal.<br>

<p>Glow plugs reinstalled with a new wiring harness.&nbsp; The glow
plugs are connected by a black wiring harness, the injectors are the ones with a
metal hard line at the top and a black fuel return line below it.
