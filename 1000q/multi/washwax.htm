<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>

<p>Here are some tips on how to properly wash your car.&nbsp; I used to think
that washing your car just meant scrubbing off the dirt with a brush, and that
is why my first car had so many micro-spiderweb scratches in the paint.&nbsp;
Improper washing or automatic car washes are the most common reason for
scratches in the paint other than parking lot rash.&nbsp; This article will
show you how to avoid scratching the paint when washing your car.</p>

<p> If
you look at the reflection of light in the paint, you will probably see a halo
of fine lines in the paint.&nbsp; These are spiderweb scratches and are caused by improper washing.&nbsp;
If you go to an automatic car wash the brushes will always put these
microscratches into your paint so if you want to use an automatic car wash, go
to only touchless car washes.&nbsp; The
worst automatic car washes could use less water which causes the brushes to put more
scratches into your paint.</p>

<p>These spiderwebs can be removed by polishing the paint, see <a href="how-to-polish-paint-porter-cable.htm">1000q: polishing paint</a>
to remove them.&nbsp; Here is an example of spiderwebs caused by poor washing techniques and
automatic car washes.&nbsp; The spiderwebs are halos of micro
scratches.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>

<p><b>Materials and preparation&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>To wash your car, first get two buckets and a soft cleaning sponge or cloth to clean your
car.&nbsp; Your washing sponge should be something that holds a lot of water and
soap, reducing the chances of tiny pieces of dirt scratching the paint.&nbsp; I would not
recommend using a brush except for rockguards or lower plastic cladding because
brushes don't hold enough water and soap to prevent scratches.&nbsp; One of the buckets should be used to contain clean soap and water, the other
bucket for rinsing the cleaning sponge.&nbsp; If you were to use the same bucket to
rinse the sponge, dirt and contaminants would stay on the sponge and scratch the
paint.&nbsp; If you want to be really careful, place a few layers of screen mesh
or other trap at the bottom of the rinse bucket to prevent dirt from getting
back onto your washing sponge.&nbsp; For soap, do not use dishwashing detergent because it is designed
to clean grease and baked on food off dishes and will strip all wax and sealants
off your car's
finish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> Also make sure that the car is out of strong direct sunlight because it can
cause spotting.&nbsp; If you park on a slight incline, it will help water run off
the car.&nbsp; If your driveway is level, you could push a 1x4 piece of wood
against the front or rear tires and drive the car's wheels onto the wood to tilt
the car.&nbsp; Make sure that the wood is not under the drive wheels, as this
could cause the wood to shoot out or slide out of place once you start
moving.&nbsp; Also make sure that no one is around the car or holding the wood
as you drive onto it.&nbsp; This trick can also be used if you have a low car
and can't fit a floor jack under the proper jack points.</p>

<p> A porter cable random orbital polisher, 1 wash bucket, 1 chenille sponge, 2
polishing pads, and 1 microfiber cloth.&nbsp; I also suggest a few more cloths
and 1 rinse bucket.</p>

<p> <b>Washing Tips</b></p>

<p>Once you have all your materials ready:</p>

<p>First thoroughly rinse the car to remove large dirt and to wet the
car.&nbsp; Do not use hot water because it strips off the wax.&nbsp; Always move the cleaning sponge in the direction that air would
move over the car, starting at the top of the car, the roof.&nbsp; Moving in a back and forth motion
instead of circles seems to reduce
the appearance of micro scratches.&nbsp; Starting at the top and move around the
car before moving to the bottom prevents the crud and sand from the bottom of the door sills, normally the dirtiest part of the car, are not put on top of the car.&nbsp;
Starting at the top also helps keep the car wet and presoaks the lower part of
the car.</p>

<p><b>Drying Your Car</b></p>

<p> You can use a drying chamois, water blade, or
microfiber towel to dry your car.&nbsp; I recommend waffle weave microfiber
towels because an errant piece of sand or dirt blown onto your car could cause a water
squeegee to push the particle, creating a scratch.&nbsp; Push microfiber towels trap it in the deep fibers.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning the Wheels and Tires</b></p>

<p>At this point, you can use the leftover soapy water to clean the
wheels.&nbsp; Wheel cleaners tend to be harsh on the paint and
tires, so I use them only if I have some tar or buildup that
cannot be removed with regular soap and water.&nbsp; There are also lots of &quot;easy
rinse off&quot; or &quot;scrub free&quot; wheel cleaners.&nbsp; They all work
100% better if you do scrub the wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tire dressing: Some tire manufacturers recommend against tire dressings, some do not address it
at all.&nbsp; Some claim that tire dressings contribute to tire sidewalls
cracking.&nbsp; Meguiar's Endurance is one brand that claims to not do
so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some dealers claim that's why your brakes creak but then they
apply it to the cars on the lot.&nbsp; Applying an excessive amount of tire
dressing can cause the excess to fling onto the car
paint once the car is moving, and this is bad for the paint.&nbsp; Try scrubbing
your tire sidewalls with soap and a brush - that will naturally restore their
appearance, so I try to avoid using tire dressings.</p>

<p><b>Cleaning the Glass&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>For glass, just use the same soap that you use on the paint.&nbsp; After
washing the glass, I highly recommend using Rain-X or a similar product to make
water bead off the glass.&nbsp; It is the one cleaning product that also
enhances safety.&nbsp;&nbsp; I apply it with a paper towel to the front windows, the side view
mirrors, and the front and rear windshields.&nbsp; It makes it so much easier to
see in the rain that after using it, you will wonder why everyone doesn't use
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have to buff it off with another paper towel or else it will
cause streaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Waxing the Car</b></p>

<p>Before you wax the car, run your hand over the paint.&nbsp; If it's smooth,
go ahead and wax.&nbsp; If it's rough and grainy, you could wash your car again
or try <a href="clay-bar-paint.htm">clay bar to remove the contaminant</a>.&nbsp;
Waxing just seals in these contaminants.</p>

<p>Waxing the car also helps preserve the finish of the paint.&nbsp; First make
sure the car is dry, then apply the wax as directed.&nbsp; It's pretty self explanatory:
apply, let dry, buff off.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have black plastic trim, avoid
putting wax onto it as wax on black trim will discolor the trim and make it appear chalky and
milky.&nbsp; Blue painter's tape works great at protecting black trim.&nbsp; To
save time, I use an electric buffer/polisher over the large areas and then cover
the smaller areas by hand.&nbsp; See the article on polishing
paint, since the technique is basically the same.&nbsp; <a href="how-to-polish-paint-porter-cable.htm">1000q:
polishing paint</a></p>

<p><b>Choice of Wax</b></p>

<p>Waxing is as necessary as washing because it lays a protective layer
on top of the paint and can make paint appear more shiny.&nbsp; If you don't
keep the car waxed, road salts and acid rain could damage the paint.&nbsp; Some
people prefer carnauba wax and some people prefer synthetic wax.&nbsp; I prefer synthetic
wax because it lasts longer, between 4-6 months.&nbsp; Carnauba wax may only
last 1-2 months.&nbsp; As a side note, I have seen liquid turtle wax that says
100% pure carnauba.&nbsp; This is incorrect because 100% pure carnauba is
solid-the turtle wax has at least additives to stay in liquid form.</p>

<p>To save time, I use a great tool for waxing and buffing the paint: the porter cable random
orbital polisher.&nbsp; Unlike a rotary polisher which spins on a single axis,
the random orbital polisher moves on a free floating head which spins on a
moving axis.&nbsp; Because of it's random motion, it greatly reduces the chance
of burning, or over-polishing the paint in any one spot.&nbsp; If you went to a
dealership or professional auto detailer, they all use something similar because
for a business, time is money.&nbsp; And it is can be used for sanding,
polishing, waxing, buffing, etc..&nbsp; It not only saves time, but it is a
necessity if you want to polish the
paint.</p>
