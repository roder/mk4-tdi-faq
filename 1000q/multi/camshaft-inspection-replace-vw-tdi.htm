<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>Here are DIY instructions on how to replace a camshaft with worn lobes on your
PD pumpe duse TDI engine in Jetta TDI, Golf, New Beetle, or Passat TDI.&nbsp;
You also have to repair bad or broken lifters during this replacement procedure.</h2>
<p>A common problem in VW and Audi TDI with pumpe duse TDI engines (PD) are worn camshaft lobes,
lifters (camshaft followers), and bearings.&nbsp; If you have a 2004-2005 VW Passat TDI (BHW),
2004-2005 Jetta (BEW), 2004-2006 Golf, New Beetle (BEW), 2005.5-2006 Jetta (BRM),
or V10 Touareg TDI, you have a PD engine.&nbsp;
Pumpe duse technology was also found in other markets with other engines years
before and after being available in North America.&nbsp; It's unknown if the V10 Touareg has this
problem since there were so few sold and it uses a completely different cylinder
head design than the 4 cylinder engines.&nbsp; Unit injector (generic name for pumpe
duse) technology is also used
on non VW/Audi diesel engines.</p>
<p>The major difference between pumpe duse VW/Audi TDI engines and other TDI engines is
  the unit fuel injectors which are actuated by the camshaft.&nbsp; Because there's limited
  space on the cylinder head, pumpe duse engines sacrificed valve lobe width to fit
  the extra lobe for the fuel injector rockers.&nbsp; See <a href="../pumpedusedesc.htm">1000q:
direct injection and pumpe duse</a> for more details.</p>
<p>While many PD engines do not have any cam wear, some get wear on a single lobe
and some
get multiple worn lobes.&nbsp; VW recommends engine oil VW spec 505.01 for pumpe duse
engines but if was only an engine oil problem it doesn't explain why there isn't
always even wear across all lobes.&nbsp; See <a href="../engineoilpump.htm">1000q:
PD engine oils</a> for a list.&nbsp; 5w-40 oil should provide more protection
than 5w-30.</p>
<p> The exact reason for excess wear is unknown but contributing factors could be manufacturing defects, poor design,
thin engine oil, insufficient oiling at the bearing, incorrect specification oil used, or other factors.&nbsp;
Some believe that even using the recommended specification engine oil won't help
because of low zinc phosphorous in modern engine oils.&nbsp; ZDDP engine oil additive would add
zinc&nbsp;but shorten catalytic converter life.&nbsp; It's unknown if this makes
a significant difference over the long term.&nbsp; Regardless of the exact cause, the fact is that by the time this problem
causes symptoms the car is
usually out of warranty.&nbsp; If the car is under warranty, this is definitely
something that should be covered.</p>
<p>Editorial speculation: It appears that #1 and 4 intake lobes are more likely to wear
first.&nbsp; Franko6 has a theory that that the factory torque spec on the rocker
bolts is too high.&nbsp; The rockers don't go all the way to the end of the cap
and when combined with other factors such as insufficient oiling, slight warping
could be a
contributing factor to camshaft lobe wear.&nbsp; This is just a guess and I am
not a professional mechanic or engineer - it also doesn't explain why only
some engines get wear.&nbsp; There are modifications to the bearing cap that
will increase oiling and might reduce wear (not just because of more lubrication
but because oil takes away heat) but it hasn't been tested over the long
term.&nbsp; Bearing caps are matched to the head
and are not interchangeable.&nbsp; There are also the option of performance camshafts from KermaTDI linked in the parts section. Feel free to <a href="../../forum/index.php">post in the
myturbodiesel forum</a> for more details.&nbsp; Any non factory modification or torque
spec is done at your own risk!</p>
<p>VW installed a mix
  of black nitrided hardened lifters and chrome non nitrided lifters across
  model years.&nbsp; VW
  probably recognized there was a problem and changed the lifters.&nbsp; Some engines have half black and half chrome
  lifters because they
  tried to cheap out.&nbsp; All replacement lifters should be black.&nbsp; The PD cylinder heads share many
  parts but the BEW engine has a
  shorter lobe and shorter duration vs. the BRM and BHW.&nbsp; This means decreased contact time, a
better oil film, and in theory, less chance of camshaft wear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The self-adjusting hydraulic lifter has ports to keep it filled with engine oil
and a &quot;button&quot; that the valve stem presses on.&nbsp; Below is a
cutaway showing the internal springs.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/vwlifter.jpg" width="804" height="232"></p>
<p>A basic inspection requires the valve cover to be removed and the camshaft
rotated to examine the lobes and lifters.&nbsp; This should tell you right away
if there is lobe wear.&nbsp; The difficulty of removing the valve cover is only 1/5.&nbsp; A through inspection requires
the timing belt to be removed (which is why the difficulty is rated 3/5) so that the camshaft can be removed to inspect the
camshaft bearings.&nbsp; If you have a pumpe duse engine and are planning to do
the timing belt soon, I suggest doing a basic camshaft inspection beforehand so that
all parts are ready and there's no extra car down time.</p>
<p>If you find that you do have any camshaft wear, take many pictures
documenting the wear.&nbsp; Keep all your receipts and try to see if VW customer
care will work with you to cover the repair cost.&nbsp; Even if they don't, I
still suggest that you keep all records.</p>

<h3>Repair procedure to replace camshaft on PD VW Jetta TDI engine,
New Beetle, Golf, or Passat</h3>
<p><b>Basic inspection</b></p>
<p>If you find the tips on this page helpful, please use the donation button at the top so that I can continue to keep publishing great articles for free. The Bentley service manual is about $80 and doesn't even mention most of the tips here. This page has color photos, more detail, and videos. This page has saved many people from unnecessary repair and I hope you find it helpful as well. Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>Remove the engine cover.&nbsp; For 2004-2005 VW Passat TDI, remove the 3x 10mm
  nuts holding it down.&nbsp; All other pumpe duse cars, just pull the engine
  cover up to remove it - they have ball-socket snaps that hold it down.&nbsp;
  You can retrofit snap sockets to the Passat engine cover, see <a href="../a4/engine-cover-pop-replace.htm">1000q:
    pumpe duse cover mod</a> (for a Jetta but same idea).</p>
<p>Remove the upper timing belt cover.&nbsp; It's held by 2 spring clips.&nbsp;
Clean the area around the valve cover.&nbsp; On the 2004 - 2006 VW Jetta, Golf,
and New beetle TDI you have to remove some intake piping to remove the
timing belt cover and get access to the camshaft sprocket.&nbsp; See <a href="../a4/vw-jetta-tdi-timing-belt-change-replacement-bew-engine.htm">10000:
BEW engine timing belt</a> if you have a 2004-2005 Jetta or 2004-2006 Golf/New
Beetle.&nbsp; See <a href="../a5/brm-VW-Jetta-TDI-timing-belt-replacement-1.htm">1000q:
BRM engine timing belt</a> for more tips and details on a 2005.5-2006 VW Jetta
TDI.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb11.jpg" width="334" height="507"></p>
<p>Clean the valve cover and the area around it.&nbsp; You don't want
oil/dirt/sand falling into the engine.&nbsp; Wipe down all tools before using
them on the exposed cylinder head.</p>
<p>Below is the 2005.5-2006 VW Jetta TDI BRM engine.&nbsp; There are some T30 torx bolts around the
perimeter of the valve cover (yellow arrows below).&nbsp; Carefully move the fuel
lines away when removing the valve cover.&nbsp; The 2004-2006 BEW engine is
similar but uses 10mm bolts to hold the valve cover.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam1.jpg" width="720" height="526"></p>
<p> Also remove the vent tube (white arrow above and below, pinch the plastic
clip to release) and rubber line
(yellow box below).&nbsp; Move the wire under the &quot;throttle&quot; intake
flap aside.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam18.jpg" width="810" height="590"></p>
<p>The trick to removing the valve cover is that you can't do it at TDC and you
can't axially twist the valve cover during removal.&nbsp; Either of these will
cause the side at the timing belt to get
caught on the camshaft sensor tabs on the camshaft pulley (green arrows
below) or the tandem pump.&nbsp; If the
camshaft side
is catching, rotate the camshaft
sprocket (with timing belt on) so that the tabs on the camshaft pulley are out of the way.&nbsp;
These tabs are highlighted in a &quot;removal possible&quot; position below.&nbsp; If
the tab is at the 2 o'clock position the valve cover will catch on it.&nbsp; Pull the valve cover up and slightly towards
you during removal.</p>
<p>Optional on Passat but not suggested: if you are planning on removing the intake manifold for cleaning, remove it before the valve cover to get a little more clearance.&nbsp;
See <a href="../b5/intake-EGR-TDI-removal.htm">1000q: intake EGR removal</a>
for more details if you have a Passat.&nbsp; Removal is tight but once you know
to rotate the camshaft to clear
the tabs on the camshaft pulley it's easy to remove the cover.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam2.jpg" width="630" height="474"><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/tdivalvecover.jpg" width="540" height="470"></p>
<p>You can now see the camshaft, lifters, rockers, and injectors (all single camshaft 4 cylinder PD engines similar)<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam3.jpg" width="900" height="471"></p>
<p>Manually turn over the engine
to rotate the camshaft.&nbsp; If you're in the process of changing the timing belt you can turn it from the camshaft or crankshaft sprocket. If not,  turn
it from the 19mm 12 point crankshaft main bolt to avoid unncessarily stressing the timing belt tensioner. You could also turn it from the camshaft sprocket if you turn it OPPOSITE engine rotation (counterclockwise).</p>
<p> As the camshaft rotates, inspect all the lobes for scratches and worn
tips.&nbsp; The injector rocker lobes (the ones in the middle) don't seem to wear
much.&nbsp; This is probably because they use roller bearings.&nbsp; The valve lobes
(the narrow ones) seem to wear on the tips and grind down the lifters.&nbsp; For unknown reasons,
I've seen more worn exhaust lobes which start on #1 and #4.&nbsp; Others have gotten worn intake
lobes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some cars have 1 worn lobe with the others perfect and other
cars have all worn lobes. </p>
<p> Each lobe has a chamfered edge -
  this means that the edges are machined with an angle instead of a sharp 90<sup>o</sup>
  angle.&nbsp; If the tip lost its chamfered edge, the edges will feel sharp and you can see the loss of the
  smooth chamfered edge.&nbsp; If this is the case, the lifter tops&nbsp; are probably
  chewed up.&nbsp; It's hard to tell how bad it is without wiping the oil off the
lifters to see them. </p>
<h3> Pictures of bad PD pumpe duse TDI engine camshaft lobe and lifter wear </h3>
<p> Below is a camshaft with minor wear on 1 lobe (injector rocker levers removed for illustration)
- it has a copper colored streaking wear area on the backside of the lobe.&nbsp;
If it's not bad, slowly rotate the camshaft and polish the copper off.&nbsp; The
bearing is worn but it's probably still usable.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam4.jpg" width="900" height="432"></p>
<p>Below are closeups of normal lobe tips with smooth, even chamfered edges.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam5.jpg" width="810" height="594"></p>
<p>Here is a brand new VW Jetta TDI camshaft lobe.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam19.jpg" width="630" height="532"></p>
<p>Here is a PD camshaft lobe with 180,000 miles on it.&nbsp; It still looks
perfectly usable.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam6.jpg" width="663" height="479"></p>
<p>Here is a bad lobe (#4) from the same camshaft with 180k.&nbsp; It has a worn tip (the light colored dots on the tip) with sharp edges where the chamfer
is worn away.&nbsp; Check both sides of the lobe tip because they can wear on
one side more than the other.&nbsp; A worn tip can be felt and seen by running a clean finger over the lobe tip and
edges.&nbsp; When a lobe is noticeably worn
it may affect how fast and long the valves stay open and may cause idle problems.&nbsp;
Once the surface is worn away it will continue to wear.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam7a.jpg" width="630" height="641"></p>
<p>You will also be able to see the lifters.&nbsp; (You should normally store
hydraulic lifters face down).&nbsp; Each lobe contacts the lifter
slightly off center.&nbsp; This causes the lifter to rotate when the
camshaft touches it.&nbsp; Visible scratches on the contact
surface of the lifters is normal but they should all be polished smooth and flat to the touch.&nbsp; A round star
or butterfly pattern of fine visible
scratches is normal because it means the lifter is rotating properly.&nbsp;
Pictures can make scratches appear more prominent so as a rule of thumb, your fingernail should not
catch on any of
the scratches.&nbsp; Gouging scratches are not normal.&nbsp; If the contact surface is caved in or dished,
this indicates lifter wear.&nbsp; They must be replaced before damage
occurs.&nbsp; This is normally caused by worn camshaft lobes. </p>
<p>If your lifters look like the one below with the dished face, the camshaft, bearings, and
lifters must be replaced.&nbsp; Replacement
requires camshaft removal, see below for further details.&nbsp; If your lifters
have minor wear replace them as soon as practical.&nbsp; In other words, the car
is still drivable but order the parts now and repair it when you have the
chance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacing
only the lifter or camshaft will cause the new one to wear into the old one and
cause wear on both parts.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam8.jpg" width="562" height="306"><br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/cam/cam9.jpg" width="582" height="325"></p>
<p>Below left is a replacement blackened lifter.&nbsp; Middle and right are the same
worn lifter from different angles.&nbsp; The black was worn away except on the
edges because a lobe with a sharp tip was starting to beat up the lifter.&nbsp;
The surface of this lifter was still flat and the car was still perfectly
drivable but it was changed to prevent further wear.&nbsp; If it continues to wear it will eat a hole into the face of the
lifter.&nbsp; Once the top of the lifter is cracked or dished, it could break
and send small metal chunks all over the cylinder head or cause severe engine
damage.<br>

    <td width="600">Here is an example of a totally destroyed lifter.&nbsp; If you have this
amount of wear do not drive the car until it's been repaired.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lobes

It was detected because the car was&nbsp;lumping.&nbsp; While poor running can
      be from a variety of causes, in this case it was from badly worn
      cams/lifters.&nbsp; Here is a video from mittzlepick of that car

<p>If your camshaft lobes and lifters appear to be good, my suggestion is to not
do further inspection of the bearings.&nbsp; It's not worth it to remove the
timing belt and camshaft to inspect the bearings.&nbsp; If you suspect bearing
wear, switch to a heavier weight oil like 5w-40 and wait until further repair is
needed.</p>

timing belt replacement on the BEW/BRM engines because timing belt replacement
requires engine mount removal.&nbsp; You don't want the dirty engine support bar
dropping dust into the exposed cylinder head and taking up room above the engine
and where you need it most.&nbsp; The engine is also more secure with the mount
attached.</p>
