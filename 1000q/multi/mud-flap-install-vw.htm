<h2>This article shows how to install front mudflaps on a VW
Passat.</h2>
<p>Other mk4 mudflaps are similar.&nbsp; While there are cheaper copies I suggest getting the OEM genuine
mudflaps because they will fit better.&nbsp; Sometimes generic parts work fine
or even better but when it comes to body parts, OEM generally fit
best.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the parts per side.<br>

<p>With the wheels pointed forward, remove the inner T25 torx screw (the one
shown below on the left).&nbsp; Because the tire is in the way, you must use a short bit instead of
a torx screwdriver.&nbsp; If you only have a torx screwdriver, remove the wheel
for clearance.<br>

<p>Turn the wheel to one side.&nbsp; Remove the outer T25 torx screw (the one
shown above on the right).&nbsp; Take
a hose and flush out any dirt accumulated behind the plastic wheel well
liner.&nbsp; Wipe off any dirt on the paint.</p>
<p>Test fit the mudflap.&nbsp;&nbsp; Loosely screw in the torx screws.&nbsp;
The inner T25 torx screw is reused in the original spot.&nbsp; The replacement for the outer T25 torx
screw is a long T25 torx screw and it is used in where the outer screw
was.&nbsp; The original outer screw goes to the lower outer spot on the mudflap.&nbsp; When I took the pic I put it in the wrong
spot so the white arrow below shows the correct spot.&nbsp; Take a punch or nail and make a small hole
for the outer lower T25 torx screw.<br>

<p>Remove the muflap and put the metal screw backing on the original plastic
fender liner with the screw hole over&nbsp; the hole you
made.&nbsp; This gives the torx screw someplace to hold onto.&nbsp; Now install the mudflap and tighten the 3 T25 torx screws.</p>
<p>Bend the plastic tabs back and then use pliers to press on the metal
clamps.&nbsp; The clamps are shown partially installed below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p> Make sure the mudflap is tight against the fender.&nbsp; The upper
clamp has a padded flap - bend it back and use it to cushion the mudflap while you press on the
clamp (shown below).&nbsp; Then cut away the padded flap.<br>
