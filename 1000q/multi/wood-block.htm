<p><i><b>Disclaimer</b>: the wood blocks shown here are not a substitute for commercially
available jack stands.&nbsp; Wood blocks are for backup use in addition to jack
stands and the safety of the plans shown here apply only to my car and my exact
situation!&nbsp; Since wood blocks can only support the car on its wheels, these are
not a replacement for jack stands on the body of the car.&nbsp; Damage to
your property, injury,
and death, or to a 3rd party, are possible consequences of not supporting your vehicle
properly and/or securely.&nbsp; If you have any doubt about the safety
of working on your car, follow all precautions as listed in the factory service
manual and take it to a professional

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>Putting wood cribbing blocks under the wheels can
spread out the weight over a larger surface compared to only using jack stands.</h2>
<p>On my car and my exact situation, they raise the car about 7-8 inches higher
than the tallest setting on my jack stands.&nbsp; These blocks are built in two sections so that
you can use the first level by itself or raise the car to the higher
level.&nbsp; Compared to using only jack stands, they won't dig into hot asphalt
(putting jack stands on top of a secure and level piece of wood can help prevent
digging)
or scratch the undercarriage of the car.&nbsp; The reason they aren't a full
replacement for jack stands is because they only support the car while it's
resting on the wheels.&nbsp; Doing any kind of suspension, brake, or anything
else that requires a wheel to be removed will still require you to use jack
stands.&nbsp; If using jack stands with wood blocks, consider the wood blocks as
backups only and make sure the car is level, balanced, and secure.&nbsp; They
can be especially useful when tightening suspension pieces.&nbsp; Generally
speaking, suspension bolts/nuts should be tightened when the suspension is in
the normal resting position.&nbsp; Because jack stands let the wheels hang down,
tightening a fully extended suspension will preload the various parts and wear
them out.&nbsp; I built these to have room under the car while letting
the car rest on the wheels to keep the suspension at rest.</p>
<p>Refer to the main FAQ for article showing where the jack points are on
various VW.</p>
<p> Never get under the car
far enough to get injured if it's being supported by any hydraulic lift/support or scissor jack!&nbsp;
Many people
have been killed when a hydraulic jack suddenly let go or slipped!&nbsp;
Hydraulic lifts or hydraulic floor jacks are designed to lift, not
support!&nbsp; Never
use cinder blocks to support a car since they cannot be easily inspected for
weakness and could suddenly crumble.&nbsp; They also have a stronger and weaker
orientation - do you want to bet your life that you know which is the strong
orientation?&nbsp; Cinder blocks are for building walls, not for supporting
cars.&nbsp; Scissor jacks are for emergency roadside wheel removal and in my
opinion, are not secure enough to get under the car.&nbsp; At no time while
changing a wheel on the side of the road should you get under the car far enough
to be crushed because they can fail:<br>

<p>Many 6 ton jack stands are about 20-23&quot; tall at full extension and will
raise the car about the same height as the wood blocks I made.</p>
<p>A test measurement before assembly showing the general layout.&nbsp; Using
this type of wood block support for a car isn't a new idea - cribbing blocks are commonly used to temporarily support heavy
objects.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/block/block3.jpg" alt="wood cribbing block" width="444" height="371"></p>
<p>Here is a picture of someone else's wood blocks with black rhino ramps shown
for comparison.&nbsp; They were made out of shipping pallets and are almost
solid.&nbsp; The front blocks are rectangular in shape so it can be used on two
sides depending on how it's laying.&nbsp; This is why it has the built-in wheel
chocks on two sides.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/block.jpg" alt="wood support car" width="800" height="533"></p>
<p> As long as they are well built from solid materials and hard wood, and in good condition, wood
blocks on a hard stable surface such
as level, solid asphalt or concrete will be very stable and strong.&nbsp;
Obviously, if they aren't properly designed for your car, damaged or rotted, not stable, or secured
together, the wood blocks and the car will topple down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> In the plan for my car, just the center column of wood on 1 block could, in theory,
(don't try this it in reality) support the entire weight of my car without
failure.&nbsp;
Weight is spread out amongst 24 sq in. of wood (middle 2 columns of
about 12 sq in. each).&nbsp; Once you add the side columns, it's well within safe real
world limits (for my car only), even after accounting for small defects or
imperfect conditions.&nbsp; A well engineered product would make this
design as light as possible while still meeting my needs but I decided to
overbuild it for peace of
mind.&nbsp; The biggest danger comes from the car tipping over so customize the
dimensions and construction of the wood blocks for your
car, otherwise it could result
in damage to property, injury, or death!&nbsp; These plans are plans for
my car only and are not specific to your car.&nbsp; Do not attempt to build
these without customizing them to your needs and for each car that you'll use it
on.&nbsp; Do not let any 3rd party use them without calculating if it's suitable
for their uses and car.&nbsp; Always inspect the wood and the surface they will
be used on for any rot, damage, or defects before use.</p>
<p>The main force the wood experiences in this design is compression
through the center column.&nbsp; Many types of wood can take up to 300 psi of compression
in the weak direction and over a thousand psi in
the strong direction.&nbsp; Wood is strongest
when stressed perpendicular to the grain and when oriented like a roof
rafter.&nbsp; The top wide piece that the tire rests on
experiences very little cross grain force since most of the compression
is transferred through the middle column directly beneath the tire.&nbsp; The
2x4 directly beneath the top layer is also distributing that force to the side bars
perpendicular to the grain.&nbsp; This
design is plenty overbuilt for my car and my intended use.&nbsp; When used with
jack stands, they are very safe and stable for my car but make sure to build
them to suit your intended load and use.&nbsp; One of the most common reasons
good, solid wood splits is because energy is focused at a spot with the
grain.&nbsp; When used with a car wheel, the tire spreads out force across the
tire contact patch.</p>
<p>If you want to test the strength of the wood blocks yourself, take a few 2x4
and crisscross them to form a stack of solid wood in the center.&nbsp; Then put
the center section under a hydraulic press.&nbsp; Do not reuse the wood on your
blocks once it's been weakened or damaged.</p>
<h3>How to use wood as jack stand backups</h3>
<p>After raising the car with a hydraulic floor jack by the jack points as
specified in your factory service manual, put the first layer of blocks under all four
tires.&nbsp; Once it's raised, use a high lift floor jack to fit the second layer under the
tires.&nbsp; Always rest all four wheels on blocks before raising to the second
level to keep the car level.&nbsp; If you try to lift the car while it's at a
great angle it could slip and fall.&nbsp; Apply the parking brake, put the car in gear or park, and chock the
wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Never
get under the car while raising, lowering, or adjusting the car.&nbsp; Hydraulic
jacks could blow a seal and collapse, get tipped over or slip, or have the
jacking point slip, so don't get under the car unless it is completely secure!</p>

<h3>My hydraulic floor jack</h3>
<p>
My personal hydraulic jack is the costco 3 ton &quot;arcan&quot; ALJ3T aluminum jack.&nbsp;
Not every store may carry it, the price is about $145 after everything.&nbsp; It's about 58 lbs vs. 100 lbs for a
comparable steel jack, has a lower padded bar to avoid scratching your car, and has a range of
3.7-19&quot; so it will fit
under most lowered cars but lift high too.&nbsp; It's not a racing &quot;quick
drop&quot; jack so lowering it is safe and controlled - avoid racing jacks in
general.&nbsp; It also has a quick lift feature.&nbsp; Another good one is the
arcan &quot;professional&quot; XL35R.&nbsp; It has a lift of 3.5-21.4&quot; and
is rated at 3.5 tons but is steel and weighs 101 lbs.&nbsp; I've heard that it
can be found at some costcos for $99 but after using a 100 lb jack, lugging it
around gets old fast so I recommend the aluminum jack.&nbsp; My experience with Craftsman
jacks is that many tend to
leak and stop lifting after a while due to dirt clogging an internal valve.&nbsp;
They can be cleaned and rebuilt but I avoid craftsman jacks now because of their
current design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Car ramp recommendations</h3>
<p>The cost in materials was about $90 for 4, so if you just need to raise the front of
the car a little bit for oil changes and such, a pair of
commercially available ramps or would be cheaper and faster since you could buy
cheap ramps as low as $50-70.&nbsp; However, rhino ramps only raise the car about
6.5&quot;, and race ramps (another brand similar to rhino ramps) only raise the
car 10&quot;.&nbsp; The wood blocks I made raise the car 7&quot; at the first
level and 14&quot; at the second level.&nbsp; This extra clearance is
necessary when doing large jobs under the car such as dropping the transmission
or subframe.&nbsp; They can also be used for keeping the car level when changing the transmission fluid or
differential in rear/all wheel drive cars.</p>
<p>
I don't like Rhino ramps because when driving up onto them with front wheel
drive cars or backing up onto them with rear wheel drive cars, the ramps can
slide.&nbsp; Any sliding is dangerous.&nbsp; They also have a 17<sup>o</sup>
incline with only a 6.5&quot; lift.&nbsp; Race ramps are much better because
they have a 10<sup>o</sup> incline (much better for low bumpers and easier to
drive up onto) and don't slide as easily across the floor.&nbsp; The Race ramp
XT 2 piece also has a removable ramp so that it doesn't take up any extra space
(the block stays under the wheel).&nbsp; They also have composite blocks to
raise and support the rear wheels.&nbsp; They are much better than Rhino ramps
but the 10&quot; lift race ramps cost over $300. </p>
<h3>Parts to build DIY wood cribbing blocks </h3>
<p><b>Yields 4 blocks 14&quot; tall, 16&quot; wide, and 24&quot; long each.</b> </p>
<p><i><b>Disclaimer</b>:&nbsp; The procedure shown were generic steps for my car
only.&nbsp; You
must measure your car to see if a 24&quot; long or 16&quot;
wide plank is stable enough for your vehicle and load.&nbsp; You must customize these plans
to fit
your needs by calculating the strength of the wood you are using vs. the amount
of weight it will support.&nbsp; Consult a qualified engineer before making your
own design or copying these generic plans.</i></p>
<p>2x4 wood planks&nbsp; (2x4s are actually 1.5&quot;x3.5&quot;, I
don't know why, they just are)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 24&quot; long 2x4 = 40 pieces<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 16&quot; long 2x4 = 44 pieces</p>
<p>2x16 wood plank, 24&quot; long = 8 pieces</p>
<p>coarse deck screws, 3.5&quot; long<br>
coarse deck screws, 2&quot; long<br>
electric hand drill and various bits (preferred)</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Many local hardware stores will cut the wood for free when you buy it.&nbsp;
This makes for faster assembly and easier transport.</p>
<p>Test stack the first block and mark it with a pencil.&nbsp; The top layer's 2 pieces act
as wheel chocks, you can leave these free moving or substitute 8 of the
16x2x4&quot; wood pieces for wheel chocks.</p>

<p>Drill a pilot hole to help prevent the wood from splitting.&nbsp; Use
deck screws to hold it together.&nbsp; If you want to make the overall height of
the blocks taller, make sure
to increase the width of the blocks to make it more stable!</p>

<p>
The first 3 levels screwed together:<br>

<p>
The bottom layer complete with end chocks screwed in.&nbsp; It's all one piece
for easy moving and storage.&nbsp; This layer can be used by itself.<br>

<p>
The bottom 3 sections of the top layer<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/block/block7.jpg" width="624" height="408"></p>

<p>
Top and bottom layers finished.&nbsp; The middle supports are lined
up with each other to support the weight of the car.&nbsp; Use wheel chocks on the top layer to hold the
wheel in place.&nbsp; Total lift in this example is about 14&quot;.&nbsp; You can put
large wood planks below the bottom layer to act as a base and raise it even higher.&nbsp;
Make sure any additional wood plank underneath is wide/long enough to be stable
and secure.&nbsp; Always make sure the car is safe and secure before getting
under the car or raising it.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/block/block8.jpg" alt="wood cribbing block plans" width="485" height="380"></p>
<p>These lift higher than regular jack stands because they are lifting from the
wheels instead of the frame.&nbsp; You could get 6+ ton jack stands but these don't take up as much space
under the car and spread out the weight over more ground.&nbsp; Below left is the first
level with a jack stand pictured for scale.&nbsp; The first level raises the car
to about as high as jack stands.&nbsp; Below right is both levels (after taking the picture
I applied wheel chocks to hold the wheels).&nbsp; Always raise all 4 corners to
the first level before raising it to the second level or else the car can get
dangerously tilted.&nbsp; This is high enough to drop the transmission on
my car and have plenty of room for bigger jobs.&nbsp; To go this high you would otherwise
need large jack stands.&nbsp; My personal opinion is that wood blocks can
sometimes be more stable when you're lifting this high.
</p>
<p>Before each use you must carefully inspect the wood and the floor surface for
any cracks, rot, termite damage, or any other defects or damage.&nbsp; Do not
use the blocks if they have any damage or defects.
</p>
<p>After having used these exact blocks on a number of cars, I would have made
the bottom block 1 layer taller and made the top block 1 layer shorter.&nbsp;
This would give a taller lift of 1.5&quot; for normal use while still keeping
the same overall height for major work.&nbsp; Again, these plans are for
my car and my use only - modify anything you make yourself for your own
requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<p>Here is an example of the front raised to the second level and the rear
raised to the first level.&nbsp; Warning: Do not raise one end to the second
level without first raising and supporting the other end because the car could become dangerously
tilted on your floor jack and slip off the jack pad.<br>
