How to adjust your VW shifter cables</h1>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows how to adjust the shifter cables on your mk3 (3rd
generation), mk4 (4th gen), or mk5 (5th gen) VW.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> Mk3 is shown first and is
different from mk4 and mk5.&nbsp; The mk6 is probably the same as mk5
cables.&nbsp; Poor shifting could also be improved by changing the gear oil with
new oil or using a different thickness oil.&nbsp; Thinner oil will let the synchronizers
engage quickly, especially in cold climates.</p>

  New Beetle, see <a href="../a4/manual-transmission-gear-oil-change-Jetta-Golf.htm">1000q: mk4 transmission

<p>There is no clutch pedal or clutch master cylinder rod screw
adjustment.&nbsp; It is a hydraulic system so there are no cables.&nbsp; If
there is poor clutch pedal action it could also be caused by a worn clutch pedal
assembly (unlikely), worn/bent clutch slave cylinder rod (unlikely), bent clutch
release lever, worn release lever pivot.&nbsp; This assumes the stock setup and
not a shimmed pivot or different specification on the flywheel step.</p>

<h3>Mk3 Jetta and Passat shifter cable adjustment</h3>


<p>Remove the air intake filter box or battery as required for access.&nbsp; A
common problem is not being able to shift into 1st gear.&nbsp; Another problem
is getting reverse when you shift into first.&nbsp; These may be due
to cable stretch and play in the plastic shifter bracket.&nbsp; Loosen the nut
(yellow arrow) and move the cable a hair towards the front of the car.&nbsp;
Retighten the nut.</p>


<p>Go for a test drive and make sure that you aren't getting reverse when you
shift into first.&nbsp; If so, you adjusted it too far.&nbsp; Just move it 2
millimeters per adjustment.<br>

<p>The plastic shifter linkage has also been known to break due to age and
wear.&nbsp; To replace it, remove the adjustment nut and slip the cable off the
end by lifting the retainer up.&nbsp; If you remove it, grease the pivots.&nbsp;
You can also use a metal replacement that shortens the side-side throw (does not
adjust the fore-aft throw) with a <a href="http://gruvenparts.com/website/cart/cart.php?target=product&amp;product_id=267&amp;category_id=60">gruvenparts
assembly</a><br>

<h3>Mk4, mk5, and  mk6 shifter adjustment procedure</h3>


<p> The factory service
manual says that on the mk4 and newer, you have to remove the center console and lock the shifter knob
to adjust the shifter cables.&nbsp; This is shown in the video at the
bottom.&nbsp; I suggest only adjusting the cable ends because it's easier and faster to pull the spring back and move the shifter
cable end forward or backwards 1 thread. If it's
  still not working then try the method in the factory service manual.&nbsp;</p>


<p> Have a helper move the shifter inside the car while you watch the shifter assembly on the transmission (shown below).&nbsp; Fore-aft adjustment should be the cable on
your right when standing in front of the car, looking down, and shown in the picture.&nbsp; Left-right adjustment should be the cable on the
left.</p>
<p>On the mk4 you should have enough room to reach in there.&nbsp; On the mk5
  Jetta and the mk6 Golf you must remove the engine air filter box for clearance,
  see <a href="../a5/air-filter-box-replacement-jetta.htm">1000q: airbox removal</a> for
  details.&nbsp; Below left is a mk4 shifter
  assembly (2002 model linkage shown earlier versions (2000) have slightly   different cable ends that the Bentley manual recommends be replaced each   time they&rsquo;re removed from the knobs on the shift levers as they utilise   a press fit; earlier designs (1998 New Beetle) are closer to the MkIII   design.)</p>
<p>Below right is the mk5 with the battery box removed for
  illustration.<br>

<p>Pull the black ring back to compress the spring (removed for
  illustration).&nbsp; This will expose the shifter cable end and release its
  threads from the threads on the cable.&nbsp; Move it forwards or backwards 1
  thread/notch to &quot;skip&quot; over the threads and then
  release the spring to clamp the end onto the cable threads.&nbsp; If you wish to lock the springs in the compressed position, turn the
  black plastic ring. This is not necessary if you're just moving the end slightly - just pull the ring back, adjust, and release.<br>

<p>You can also grease the pins on the linkage to make the ends move
smoother.&nbsp; Release it by lifting the center tab on the clip.&nbsp; I
suggest doing it while it's secured to the cable so that it stays indexed to the
cable end.</p>

<p>Go for a test drive and check for proper shifter response.</p>
