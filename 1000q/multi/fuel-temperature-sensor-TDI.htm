<h2>This article shows how to replace the fuel temperature sensor or injection
pump cover seal on a VW TDI or Audi TDI.</h2>
<p>The fuel temperature sensor is one factor that tells the ECU how to adjust the amount of fuel injected.&nbsp; When
the fuel is warm, it's less dense and burns more readily so the ecu injects
more fuel to get the same mass of fuel and retards the timing.&nbsp; When the
fuel is cold, it's more dense so the ecu injects less fuel and advances the
timing.&nbsp; Hot fuel
has the same effect as higher cetane fuel at a lower temperature because it
burns more readily.&nbsp; Timing and injection quantity is also based on many other factors, fuel
temperature is just one of them.</p>
<p>If this sensor fails, it will set a check engine light (aka. DTC/MIL/CEL) and the
ECU will replace the faulty value with a nonsense temperature of -5<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp;
This lets it use a &quot;fall back&quot; setting so that fuel economy and engine operation
is only slightly affected.&nbsp; A dealership may tell you that the entire
injection pump is bad and needs to be replaced although this one sensor is actually user
serviceable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not just ignore the light?&nbsp; The check engine
light will result in emissions test failure in many states that
have emissions testing, and the engine will not inject the correct amount of
fuel.&nbsp; The car is still safely drivable, but your fuel will be slightly off
peak economy.</p>
<p>Here are some values you may see if you put the sensor in water for testing. The sensor pins on the harness are 4 and 7.<br>
  0&deg;C - 15200-17300 &#8486;<br>
  10&deg;C - 9250-11500 &#8486;<br>
  20&deg;C - 5500-6500 &#8486;<br>
  30&deg;C - 3790-4270 &#8486;<br>
  40&deg;C - 2650-3100 &#8486;<br>
  50&deg;C - 1800-2200 &#8486;<br>
  60&deg;C - 1200-1600 &#8486;<br>
  70&deg;C - 850-920 &#8486;<br>
  80&deg;C - 600-660 &#8486;<br>
  90&deg;C - 425-480 &#8486;<br>
100&deg;C - 325-370 &#8486; </p>
<p>The top cover for the injection pump can also leak, this article shows how to
replace it.</p>

<h3>Sensor or seal replacement procedure
</h3>
<p>First clean the area around the injection pump cover.&nbsp; You don't want
debris entering the sensitive area of the injection pump.&nbsp; Make sure the
engine bay is cold and have a fire extinguisher in your workspace.&nbsp; Make
sure all combustible fumes are exhausted from the area and do not introduce any
ignition sources or sparks while working on the fuel system.&nbsp; I also
suggest wearing gloves to keep diesel fuel off your hands.</p>
<p>Wad some paper towels behind the injection pump.&nbsp; The mk3 pump is normally
tilted backwards so you only have to stuff paper towels behind and to the side
of the pump.&nbsp; The mk4 pump is tilted forward so quite a bit of fuel will
spill out.&nbsp; At least 5-6 paper towels are required to catch the fuel.&nbsp;
Remove the injector fuel return line and wrap with a paper towel to catch any spilled
fuel - the fuel system should not be under pressure in these cars
that use a Bosch VE injection pump since there is no electric fuel pump anywhere
on the car.</p>
<p> Remove the
3x T20 bolts and 1x triangle security
bolt with the triangle socket circled below.&nbsp; The injection pump cover should
come off easily, be prepared for some fuel to spill out.&nbsp; You don't
want the fuel on the coolant lines or any other rubber hoses so make sure the
paper towels are stuffed behind the pump!<br>

<p>Unscrew the fuel temp sensor (T10 x 2 screws) and replace.&nbsp; It's the
black thermistor, the thing that looks like it's holding a pill.&nbsp; I don't know
the exact torque for the T10 screws, but 3-4 lbs should be more than enough,
the T10 screws are very small and LIGHT hand tight is more than enough
force.&nbsp; Any more and you will strip the torx head.&nbsp; The heads are
pretty shallow.&nbsp; The
sensor will only fit well one way, the numbers should face up. </p>

<p>You can also check the resistance of the fuel temp sensor and compare it to
the old sensor.&nbsp; It should be about 1300-1800 ohms at room
temperature.&nbsp; With the ignition on, one side gets about 5V and goes to
the ecu, the other side is ground.&nbsp; Also inspect for unusual wear or dirt
in the injection pump area.&nbsp; It should be very clean with no visible
wear.&nbsp; Inspect for bubbles or specks in the electronics and plastic - there
should be none.</p>
<p>In my case, the bad sensor was related to an electrical short on the wiring
harness.&nbsp; Carefully inspect the wiring harness for shorts, cracks, or
rubbing.&nbsp; A bad sensor could also be related to water in the fuel.</p>
<p>Installation is the reverse of removal.&nbsp; If you decided to damage the
triangle head bolt by hammering a socket onto it to remove it, here are some
specs on the bolts.</p>
