<p><b><font size="4">Introduction&nbsp;</font></b></p>

<p>The VW TDI was introduced to the US in 1996.&nbsp; There was a turbocharged ecodiesel
available in Canada but there are some big differences between the ecodiesel and
TDI.&nbsp; The ecodiesel has
less performance, no intercooler, a cold start assist handle on the dashboard,
and the glow plugs were activated by opening the driver's side door.&nbsp; It
also had the old style cable operated Bosch injection pump.&nbsp; The TDI had more
powera drive by wire throttle and injection pump, an intercooler, no cold start assist handle, and the glow
plugs were activated by the ignition key.&nbsp; The 1996 TDI was the first year
for the electronically controlled Bosch injection pump.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The passat TDI was offered in 1996-1997 in the US.&nbsp; The jetta TDI was
offered 1997-1999. Note that some 1999 jetta are actually 4th generation 1999.5
models.&nbsp; (The 4th generation of VW started in 1998 with the new beetle).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> The only major difference in the mk3 diesels was that some first year 1997 jetta
TDI used the 1Z engine
from the passat, later years used the AHU engine.&nbsp; These engines are
functionally identical for the average user.&nbsp; Below are some more
differences between the jetta/passat.&nbsp; Many of their differences
are because the passat was available in 1996-1997 and the jetta was available in
1997-early 1999.&nbsp; Aside from the obvious differences like body panels, size, etc.,
below is a list of known differences.</p>

<p>Sales numbers for the passat, for North America only<br>
1995: 64 sedans, wagons unknown. (early 1996 models)<br>
1996: 3472 sedans, 1405 wagons.<br>
1997: 2216 sedans, 87 wagons.<br>
1998: unknown. (leftover 1997 models)</p>

<p>Side note - for North American market only:&nbsp; about 2-3 1998 mk4 passats
(newer body style) were sold to customers after use as dealer information and car show
demos.&nbsp; This model was not imported officially because the 90 hp engine was
deemed to be underpowered for the newer, heavier passat.&nbsp; One sedan has
been spotted but it had very high wear due to many people getting in and out at
car shows, etc.&nbsp; If you want a mk4 passat, your best option is to get a
2004-2005 passat.&nbsp; See <a href="b5/vw-passat-TDI-buying-guide.htm">1000q:
mk4 Passat buying guide</a> for more details.&nbsp; If you want a project you could
buy a mk4 passat and swap in the engine, transmission, wiring harness,
computer, and dashboard.&nbsp;

<p><b><font size="4">Body/Interior</font></b></p>
<p>The passat was available in the US as both a sedan and station wagon called
the variant, the jetta was available as a sedan only.&nbsp; The only jetta wagon
sold was the mk4 jetta and the mk5 sportwagen.&nbsp; Many minor panels on the passat station wagon are not
compatible with the passat sedan.&nbsp; For example, the taillights look similar but
they have different part numbers.&nbsp; From the b pillar back, the body panels
and interior of the wagon are slightly different.&nbsp; The headliner, rear
seats, rear doors, sheet metal are not interchangeable with the passat
sedan.&nbsp; The wagon and sedan are interchangeable from the b pillar
forward.&nbsp; The station wagon also has a larger fuel tank than the sedan and is
the largest fuel tank on any VW diesel sold in North America.&nbsp; The station
wagon can hold about 3 gallons more than the
sedan, 8 gallons more if you use the vented fill up capacity.&nbsp; See <a href="a3b4/vent-fuel-tank-tdi.htm">1000q:
venting the fuel tank</a> for more details on that.</p>
<p>Although the passat front seats look similar to the jetta, the passat has one
more axis for adjustment of the seat.&nbsp; The front seats can be directly
swapped between mk3 cars but cannot be swapped between mk3 and mk4 cars without
customization of the brackets.&nbsp; The
offset of the jetta/passat seats are not the same.&nbsp; If you put jetta
seats into the passat, it shifts you towards the door about 1/2 inch so that the
steering wheel is slightly to the side, most people don't notice it.</p>
<p>No passat is prewired for cd changers.&nbsp; Later jetta may be wired for cd
changers, some are not.&nbsp; The passat/jetta cd changers are not compatible
with each other because they used a different head unit (radio).&nbsp; Late
jettas had a different head unit that was used with mk4 style cd changers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The passat has a interior cabin air filter.&nbsp; The jetta does not but it can be
added, just add a foam gasket and bracket.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Engine</font></b></p>
<p>The engines are almost identical with a few small differences and most of
the parts are interchangeable between the 1Z and AHU:</p>
<p>The passat and jetta do not have an anti shudder valve.&nbsp; All later
generation mk4 diesels have an anti shudder valve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1996 passat has an EGR but no EGR cooler, the 1997 jetta and passat and
all tdi models afterwards had both EGR and EGR cooler.&nbsp; Sending the exhaust gas through a cooler
(cooled with engine coolant) before putting it through the EGR valve into the
intake reduces nox emissions&nbsp; No EGR at all can produce three times as much
nox as a properly functioning EGR.&nbsp; Note that in all cars, the EGR valve is
shut at full throttle, so the EGR has no effect on top end power.&nbsp; Because the 1996 model does not have
the EGR cooler it is slightly easier to remove the intake manifold for cleaning
or repair and has higher nox emissions.&nbsp; Refer to <a href="a3b4/clean-intake-manifold-tdi.htm">1000q:
intake removal</a> for details on removing the intake or EGR for cleaning.</p>
<p>The 1996 passat used a
supplementary 5th injector for emissions that was removed for 1997 models and should be
disabled for less smoke.&nbsp; See <a href="a3b4/5th-fuel-injector-passat-tdi.htm">1000q:
5th injection disable on 1996 passat</a> for more details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The engine in the 1996-1997 passat and some 1997 jetta is the 1Z
motor.&nbsp; All other jettas 98-99 use the AHU engine.&nbsp; They are slightly
different but have many interchangeable parts.&nbsp; The mk3 jetta AHU engine pistons
are the same as mk4 jetta ALH and Euro only 110hp AFN engine pistons.&nbsp; The
piston is
stronger than the passat and early 1997 1Z pistons.&nbsp; The head design is also
stronger but uses smaller valves.&nbsp; There is no
functional or noticeable
difference to the driver.&nbsp; The only case in which the 1Z's weaker engine would make a
difference is if you are custom modifying your power levels way beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>For some reason, there was a parts shortage so a few 1Z engines had
undersized pistons.&nbsp; This could cause a low reading on the compression test
due to excess clearance and excessive engine wear.&nbsp; Read how to do a
compression test at <a href="multi/compression-test-VW-TDI.htm">1000q:
compression test - how to</a>.&nbsp; The only solution is
an engine rebuild with the correct pistons.</p>
<p>The injection pump in the jetta AHU engine uses a higher pressure with higher break
pressures.&nbsp; The mk3 cars used 4 different part numbers for injection pumps,
3 of which are interchangeable without any problem.&nbsp; Note that the VW part
numbers do NOT reflect the changes in the Bosch part numbers and small changes
so the dealer will not know about the differences, I think the VW part number
catalog shows the same part number for all mk3 cars.&nbsp; The big difference
was an increases in fuel pressure in the AHU pump.&nbsp; The 1Z passat used a
lower fuel pressure pump partly due to a different cam used in the injection
pump.&nbsp; The AHU used a higher pressure injection pump due to the cam and is
plug-play with the 1Z.&nbsp; See <a href="multi/renaultip.htm"> 1000q:
renault injection pump disassembly part 1</a> and <a href="multi/renaultip2.htm">disassembly
part 2</a> for
a detailed look at a diesel injection pump showing the cam plate inside of
an injection pump.&nbsp; The renault pump is not for the VW but it similar in
design to earlier VW
injection pumps.&nbsp; You can also retrofit an injection pump from an mk4 car,
see <a href="a3b4/injection-pump-alh-swap-repair-tdi.htm">1000q: ALH injection pump
swap</a> for more details.</p>
<p>The jetta uses a KKK-03-06 turbo, except 1997 which may have the 1Z
engine.&nbsp; The 1Z engine (all passat and some jetta), used a Garrett G-15
turbo.&nbsp; Functionally they are pretty much the same, both are
conventional wastegate style turbos, and are interchangeable.&nbsp; Read more about turbocharging in <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q:
turbocharging</a>.</p>
<p>The jetta has a one way free wheeling pulley on the alternator, the passat
does not.
</p>
<p>The 1Z and AHU turbo oil line and oil pressure sensor are in different
locations.
</p>
<p>The original fill coolant on the early passat was blue VW G11 coolant.&nbsp;
The original fill on late passat and all jetta was pink G12.&nbsp; They are not
compatible and should not be mixed.&nbsp; See <a href="a3b4/coolant-flush-tdi.htm">1000q:
coolant flush</a> for more details.<br>
</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Other mechanical</font></b></p>
<p>The mk3 diesel passat and jetta were available as manual transmission only.&nbsp;
They were only available with an automatic transmission with a gasoline engine.</p>
<p>The security system alarm horn is mounted under the driver's side windshield molding in the
jetta.&nbsp; The passat alarm horn is in the passenger side fender well.</p>
<p>The n75 solenoid, the one that controls the turbo wastegate, is on the top
driver's side firewall on the passat.&nbsp; In the jetta, it is by the air
intake accordion
hose on the passenger side.</p>
<p>The passat has rear disc brakes.&nbsp; The jetta has rear drum brakes but
they can be converted to disc brakes.&nbsp;
Front brakes are identical.</p>
<p>The front suspension lower control arm bushings on the 1990-97 passat,
1985-2005 golf/jetta/newbeetle, 1995-2002 cabrio, 1990-1995 corrado are all the
same, you can replace them with Audi TT bushings for a firmer feel, all are
interchangeable.&nbsp; Note that there were 2 versions of the Audi TT bushings,
one small and one post-recall larger bushing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to the additional size and weight of the passat, everything else being
equal, it will have less performance/handling/mileage such as braking and acceleration
because the front brakes and engine/transmission are almost identical to the
jetta.</p>
<p>The 1996 passat has an extra 5th fuel injector that adds fuel to the catalytic
converter to improve emissions.&nbsp; They also may smoke more due to the poor
function of this 5th injector.&nbsp; The fix
for this is converting to the 1997 passat ECU that compensates for the lost
injector (for emissions) and fuel injectors.</p>
<p>Different ECU between 1996, 1997 passat and jetta.&nbsp; The 1996 uses a
plastic cased BK ecu, the 1996 with the ecu recall uses the metal cased GQ ecu,
the 1996 passat uses the metal cased FA ecu.</p>
<p>1996 passat is OBD-I.&nbsp; 1997 passat is OBD-II.&nbsp; The 1996 with the
pre-recall BK ecu has a feature where you can get some check engine codes by
turning the key to &quot;on&quot; and pumping the accelerator pedal all the way to the
floor 5 times in under 5 seconds.&nbsp; Count the number of blinks of the check engine light (CEL). The four digit code will be displayed as four counts of blink that will repeat ( **,**,**,*....**,**,**,*...). In this example the code is 2221, Manifold Absolute Pressure control.&nbsp;
Note that the blink code is different than the vag-com code (00575).<br>
Blink code 4444 indicates a BK ECU with no faults of those supported. A constantly illuminated CEL, no blink at all, indicates a non-BK ECU.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that the passat 1996 recall GQ ecu and the 1997 FA ecu do not have the
code feature.&nbsp; Since the 1996 recall ecu does not have this feature and it
wont' display all of the codes accessible with a VAG-COM, this feature is
effectively useless.</p>
<p>Also note that the BK ecu circuit board is not compatible with any other car
other than the 1996 passat.&nbsp; If you need a replacement and don't have a
post recall GQ ecu, you can use an A3 Jetta's JB ecu and have the data reflashed
to work on your 1996 car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The passat has a switch under the clutch pedal that is connected only to the
cruise control circuit.&nbsp; Most cars including the mk3 jetta also has this
switch connected to the starting system clutch interlock in addition to the cruise
control.&nbsp; You must press down the clutch pedal to
start the jetta but not the passat.</p>
