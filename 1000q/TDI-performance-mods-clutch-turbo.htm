<h1>Advanced and extreme level performance upgrades for TDI engines</h1>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<p>Once you have done the <a href="TDI-power-mods-chip-tune.htm"> basic performance
modifications</a>, more extreme and more
expensive modifications can give you more
power.&nbsp; While these modifications will increase the power, they may also
slightly decrease the reliability of your car.&nbsp; The first few
&quot;advanced&quot; modifications can be
purchased as off the shelf components or by vendors requiring little modification
or customization by the installer.&nbsp; At the bottom are &quot;extreme&quot; level modifications which would be
completely custom jobs and would require a higher level of customization and
fabrication by the owner (or mechanic).&nbsp;&nbsp;Also remember that one
modification by itself may not give the full &quot;advertised&quot; power
increase, adding supporting modifications creates a synergy which increases the
effectiveness of the other upgrades.&nbsp; In other words, 2 modifications that
would each give 10 hp when installed separately would give 25 hp when both
installed.</p>
<p>With all of these modifications except the larger intercooler or clutch kit,
there is a risk of blowing head gaskets from excess pressure or melting pistons
or damaged bearings if you are lucky.&nbsp; If you are unlucky, a cracked rod
will shoot through the engine block and blow a hole in the side of the engine.&nbsp;
None of these modifications except the intercooler or clutch kit are
recommended without basic knowledge of how it works and what you expect the
result will be!&nbsp; Also note that additional power is pointless if you don't
have traction, so make sure you choose a tire that can put the power to the
ground!</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that when doing these modifications to a 4 cylinder VW
engine, depending on your personal preferences, you may be reaching the point of
diminishing returns where a diesel truck or gasoline sports car would be more
cost efficient in terms of speed vs money spent.&nbsp; Of course, none of these
will give the same gas mileage as a small 4 cylinder diesel will but this
article's focus is on power upgrades, not fuel economy!&nbsp; For example, a
Dodge Ram Cummins with a 5.9L can get 400hp
and 700 torque with just basic performance upgrades using off the shelf parts and
a lot less money and effort than taking a VW to 240 hp and 300 lb-ft tq!&nbsp; In the end, the whole point of modifying your car is to
suit your taste and preferences, so read on!</p>

<h2><a name="Advancedper">Advanced performance upgrades</a></h2>
<p><b>These upgrades are <a href="multi/difficulty_scale.htm">difficulty
level 2-5+</a>, depending on your experience and access to fabrication.</b></p>
<h3>Larger intercooler&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Every car that runs higher than stock boost levels could benefit from this.&nbsp;
The reason why I listed this as an advanced performance modification instead of
a basic performance modification is because some intercoolers advertised as
direct bolt on still require up to 8 hours of test fitting and
modification.&nbsp; Other year TDIs have no off the shelf aftermarket
intercooler upgrade at all, so they would be custom jobs.&nbsp; Installing a chip to raise the power of the diesel is only a
difficulty
level of 1.&nbsp; Installing
an aftermarket intercooler would be rated at a <a href="multi/difficulty_scale.htm">difficulty
of 2 to 3</a>, depending on access to tools and fabrication experience.&nbsp; A completely
custom intercooler would be rated at difficultly level 4.&nbsp; Basically, the intercooler would have to fit inside the space of the old
intercooler, have the correct piping and piping adapters, most likely silicone
adapters, and have the proper mounting holes to bolt up to the old spot.&nbsp;
All of this requires detailed measurement and parts sourcing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> There are
aftermarket side mount intercoolers available for VW Mk4 cars but the bottom pokes out beyond the bottom of the front fascia, leaving it more
vulnerable to parking or speed bump damage than the stock intercooler.&nbsp; If
this is acceptable to you, it is your best choice.&nbsp; There are also front
mount kits available for VW Mk5 cars to replace the stock front mount
intercooler, but they require test fitting and cutting to
install.&nbsp; With all other makes of turbocharged diesels, your
best bet is to talk to a local auto performance shop that specializes in turbo
and fabrication.&nbsp; Here are some pictures of a VW Mk4 car with aftermarket
intercooler, click the thumbnails for a larger view.</p>
<p><a href="../images/sideint.jpg"><img border="0" src="../images/sideinttn.jpg" width="256" height="247"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="../images/bumpext.jpg"><img border="0" src="../images/bumpexttn.jpg" width="256" height="192"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="../images/sidemount.jpg"><img border="0" src="../images/sidemounttn.jpg" width="256" height="192"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In choosing components, remember that bar-plate intercoolers, while more
expensive, are efficient air-air intercooler designs.&nbsp; For more details
on intercooler design, please read <a href="turbocharging.htm#intercooler">1000q:
turbocharging- intercoolers</a>.&nbsp; Also try to fit quality silicone couplers
and t-bolt clamps since they tend to leak less.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Custom chip tuning</h3>
<p>This is a chip that is custom to your car.&nbsp; Since each car is slightly
different, using an off the shelf aftermarket chip that is tailored to your
specific modifications will still leave untapped power and economy.&nbsp; A
custom chip may give the car slightly better power and economy, each car is
different.&nbsp; In addition, your tolerance for smoke, having a stronger
clutch, etc., are all different.&nbsp; Dieselinside and KermaTDI's chip tuning takes logs
of your setup and adjusts it as necessary.&nbsp; It is done by email and
requires your feedback on setup.&nbsp; Rocketchip also is known for custom
tuning on-site tuning.</p>
<h3>Clutch/flywheel/pressure plate kit</h3>
<p>With more torque comes the need for more clamping force at the clutch.&nbsp; Since
turbo diesel engines produce more torque than horsepower, this can quickly
create a slipping clutch if you go beyond the basic performance
modifications.&nbsp; TDIs also tend to produce boost spikes which create a
power spike, creating clutch slip where there otherwise shouldn't be.&nbsp;
Clutch kits are rated for torque, so choose a clutch that will
exceed the projected level of power you want.&nbsp; I also suggest choosing a
street, full faced clutch disk.&nbsp; Puck clutches, clutches that are star
shaped instead of a round disc, are best for drag racing because
they engage quickly and harshly.&nbsp; Puck clutches are either engaged or not and this will cause
harsh drivability in normal street driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some
people say that puck clutches are fine for street use but I suggest that
you not get one unless you have already driven a similar puck clutch because drivability
is highly subjective.&nbsp; Unless you plan on drag strip use, I do not suggest
a puck clutch.</p>
<p>Please read <a href="clutch-kit-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: clutch FAQ</a> for a lot more
details, pictures, and basic VW TDI clutch details.&nbsp; See <a href="a3b4/vw-jetta-passat-transmission-removal.htm">1000q:
mk3 remove transmission</a> and <a href="a3b4/clutch-rear-main-seal-tdi.htm">1000q:
mk3 remove clutch</a> for more details on mk3 1996-1999 jetta/passat.&nbsp; The common upgrade for
the TDI is a vr6 pressure plate and clutch.&nbsp; The
TDI clutch is not the same as a vr6 clutch, it has a different part number and
is slightly different.&nbsp; The vr6 clutch kit will be a direct bolt on to the
mk3 flywheel, mk4 cars require either a new flywheel or a mk4 specific clutch
kit because they use a dual mass flywheel.</p>
<p>The stock flywheel for diesel cars is sufficient to reuse if you want to keep
the same size.&nbsp; Just make
sure to resurface it whenever you install a new clutch disk and wipe the
flywheel and pressure plate down
with rubbing alcohol or brake cleaner before installation for best results.&nbsp; Also note that
for drag strip cars, a heavy flywheel is preferable to a light flywheel.&nbsp;
This is because you can store more energy in a heavy spinning flywheel to get
the best 60' time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a DSG transmission, the official limit is 258 lb-ft torque for
the transmission.&nbsp; HPA motorsports did endurance testing on high powered
VW's DSG
transmission and found that they held up fine with early fluid
changes.&nbsp; See more specifics about the DSG in <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
DSG FAQ</a>.</p>
<h4>Larger turbocharger</h4>
<p>An larger turbocharger will supply a greater flow of air more efficiently at
higher boost levels than a smaller turbo that has exceeded it's efficiency
range.&nbsp; Keep in mind that larger turbos trade higher rpm performance
for some lower rpm performance.&nbsp; In other words, you lose low end power and
gain high end power.&nbsp; If you have a 4 cylinder diesel and use it for
everyday driving, I wouldn't choose a turbo that is too large since you lose
more low end power for daily driving than a 6 or 8 cylinder
diesel.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a VNT turbo, the loss of low end power will not
be as noticeable compared to a conventional turbo.&nbsp; If you have already made other performance
modifications, the level of low end power may still be higher than a stock car
and since drivability is highly subjective, it's best to test someone else's car
first.&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q: turbocharging</a>
for more details on turbocharging theory.<br>

<p>See <a href="tditurbo.htm">1000q: Volkswagen TDI turbo upgrade chart</a> for
a comparison of available turbos.&nbsp; This chart is not all the possible
turbos that could be used, just the ones that are sold by TDI
vendors.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not an endorsement of any specific turbo or vendor.</p>
<p>Many diesel parts vendors sell hybrid (a combination of stock and larger
components) and larger off the shelf turbos that can be directly bolted onto
the stock turbo location.&nbsp; Unless you have experience in choosing turbo
components, get plenty of advice before changing the turbocharger.&nbsp; Don't
rely on one person's advice because their preferences for drivability and performance
goals may be different than yours and is highly subjective!</p>
<h3>Exhaust downpipe for increased turbo response</h3>
<p>The section of exhaust piping coming out of the turbo is called a downpipe,
due to the configuration of the cars.&nbsp; A few cars have the turbo exhaust
exiting up in which case the pipe is called an up-pipe.&nbsp; The section of
piping immediately downstream of the turbo is the most flow sensitive part of
the whole exhaust.&nbsp; There are vendors who sell these parts as direct-bolt on
modifications for the mk3 and mk4 generation cars.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the bottleneck downstream resulting from
a stock exhaust will reduce the efficiency of this part, but every little bit
helps.&nbsp; To get the most value and most performance from a downpipe, use it
with a full custom exhaust.&nbsp; No vendor sells an
off-the-shelf full turbo back exhaust.&nbsp; See <a href="turbocharging.htm#splitdownpipe">1000q:
turbocharging: downpipe</a> for pictures and more detailed explanations.</p>
<h3>Full custom TDI exhaust system (cat back or turbo back)</h3>
<p>The article <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q: turbocharging</a> has a lot more information
and pictures on choosing exhaust
components and identifying quality parts.&nbsp; Building a full custom exhaust
yourself requires some fitment and experience welding, so I have included it
in as the most difficult advanced level performance modifications.&nbsp; Of
course, a cat back exhaust can be made at any muffler shop so most people will
not be doing the welding themselves since it would probably be much easier and
faster to go to a muffler shop.&nbsp; There are no vendors that sell off-the-shelf
turbo back performance exhaust systems for the TDI.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while few shops can make a custom downpipe since it
requires more fitment testing and removal of more components than most shops
want to work on (or that you want to pay), almost all muffler shops can make a custom
downpipe-back exhaust because it is easily accessed.&nbsp; Downpipes are also
exposed to much more heat than cat-back exhausts so the need for high quality
workmanship is less.&nbsp; Avoid adding
a straight pipe without a muffler because states that require emissions
inspections require a muffler and it will result in an obvious failure during visual
inspection.&nbsp; A well designed muffler will also not reduce the amount of
power you make and will make the exhaust much quieter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, adding
straight pipes may cause an annoying droning resonance at lower rpms unless you
add resonators or venturi restrictors inside the exhaust.</p>
<p>By removing restrictions in the exhaust system after the turbo, you create
the greatest energy ratio before and after the turbo, making the turbo more
efficient.&nbsp; This means making the exhaust piping as straight as possible,
using only mandrel bends, making sure the downpipe flow is smooth, and removing
emissions equipment (such as catalytic converters, for off road use only!)</p><br>

<a name="Extremeper">Extreme level performance modifications</a></h3>
<p><b>Everything here is a <a href="multi/difficulty_scale.htm">difficulty
level of 5 or 5+</a>...unless you pay someone else to do it.&nbsp; Even then you will
have a hard time finding some who knows the car, knows what to do, and lives
nearby.&nbsp; Be prepared to send parts out to an expert.</b></p>
<p><b>Tubular exhaust manifolds</b></p>
<p>Well designed equal length tubular manifolds are always better in performance
than cast iron manifolds but are less durable, cost more, and are difficult to
fabricate.&nbsp; They
enhance turbo exhaust flow by making sure that the exhaust pulses do not
interfere with each other.&nbsp; Since the exhaust pulses come out of the
cylinder head at different times, making the exhaust runners the same length
helps the exhaust pulses arrive at the turbo collector area without colliding
with the other exhaust pulses due to timing.&nbsp; This enhances flow and turbo spool up.&nbsp; Please read <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q: turbocharging</a> for
a more detail explanation of turbo theory.&nbsp; The stock turbo may also be
part of the exhaust manifold so changing just the manifold may not be possible
without more modification.&nbsp; If you are in the market for a tubular manifold
then you should have no problem with the necessary modifications since it will
all be a custom project...or be prepared to pay someone else to do it!</p>
<p>The major problem with tubular manifolds that they are difficult to fabricate and fit in the
limited engine bay space.&nbsp; Since they are also welded instead of cast iron,
it is only a matter of time before the welds crack and leak out exhaust
gases.&nbsp; Every welded manifold will crack, the only difference is that good
materials and good welds will last much longer than poor materials and poor
welds.&nbsp; I am not referring to time intervals beyond the life of your car, a
mediocre tubular manifold could fail in 1000 miles. The problem is that the constant heat cycling, the weight of the
turbo and pipes hanging off the exhaust manifold, and greater engine vibration,
especially in a diesel engine, will weaken the metal until it cracks.&nbsp; A good weld
can actually outlast
the metal around it but in this case, the metal around the weld will just crack.&nbsp; A cast iron manifold is cast in 1 piece so they are much less susceptible
to cracking during the normal lifespan of your car.&nbsp; However, the
exhaust manifold can be removed without too much trouble in the TDI, so it's up
to you.&nbsp; For cars that require lots of effort to remove the exhaust
manifold, I would rather get a cast manifold.</p>
<p>Since this article was written, vendors have come out with
aftermarket manifolds for the TDI.&nbsp; Unless you have access to a high
quality fabricator nearby, I would contact the vendors directly to see what
options they have.&nbsp; Here are direct links to compare cast manifolds from
from <a href="http://jsperformance.ca/product_info.php?cPath=57_139&amp;products_id=279">JSperformance</a>,
from <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-60/A-VNT-dsh-20-turbo-exhaust/Detail">Kermatdi</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each appears slightly different in coatings or other
modifications so contact the vendor directly to see what they offer.</p>

<h4>Modified long block</h4>

<p>This is the most extreme level of engine modification since it requires a new
or rebuilt engine and a high level of testing and knowledge.&nbsp; If the car already has modified engine supporting modifications
such as a full custom exhaust, a larger fuel system and turbocharger, a larger
intercooler, but you still want more power, you need a custom engine.&nbsp; Some
goals of a custom engine would be boring to make the cylinders larger in
diameter, stroking to make the up and down stoke of the pistons longer (not
desirable in diesels), or
lowered compression ratios by dishing out the cylinder face or bowl.&nbsp; Dishing out
the cylinder face or deepening the bowl in the piston lowers the compression
ratio.&nbsp; By lowering
the compression ratio, you lose low end power but can use higher turbo boost and
can gain high rpm power.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the amount of money required after all these modifications
will exceed the price of buying a used sports car that will still be faster and
handle better than what you will end up with.&nbsp; I personally feel that this
level of modification is not cost effective, but so is buying new cars and modifying
your car, so it's up to you!&nbsp; Since labor is about the
same, larger engines give a better bang for the buck. </p>

<p>Basically, if you have arrived at this level of modification of 5+
difficulty, you know more than me and should
already be experienced with custom modifications and know all the details of
what you want already.&nbsp; Here is an example of an
engine with a reduced compression ratio (achieved by boring out the piston bowl)<br>
