<p>A basic understanding of your car and its diesel engine will
increase your knowledge of how to drive efficiently, why it's special, and empower you when it comes
time to work on it, either by you or by the mechanic.&nbsp; This article
is a basic &quot;how things work&quot; on the TDI engine and how it's different from a gasoline
engine.&nbsp; For
details on differences between the TDI 1996-2003 Bosch injection pump, 2003-2007
pumpe duse, and 2009 and newer common rail engines, see <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">1000q:

<h2>The Basic Parts of a TDI engine</h2>
<p>The parts of the car that are discussed here are the engine and transmission.&nbsp; All car engines are basically air pumps.&nbsp;
Pumping air and through the engine while burning fuel releases energy which is
converted by the engine and drivetrain to turn the wheels.&nbsp;
The
more air/fuel you burn, the more energy an engine can put out.&nbsp;</p>
<p> There are a few ways
to move more air to burn more fuel and make more power: spin the engine faster by revving it up,
get a larger engine to move more air, or compress the air so that more air fits
into a smaller engine.&nbsp; Performance Honda engines are known for being smaller engines that rev high to make more power.&nbsp;
The advantage is that you use less fuel, less weight, less space, and normally
better fuel economy.&nbsp; Disadvantages are that these high revving small
engines have less torque (also known as &quot;pick up&quot;, that immediate push when you
step on the gas).&nbsp; Why not rev every engine higher to make more power?&nbsp;
Due to design limitations, some engine component will scatter or break at a high
enough rpm.&nbsp; This is why engines have redlines and is among the reasons why diesels cannot rev too fast.</p>
<p>A larger engine would make more power, but it takes up more room, usually costs more to build,
weighs heavier, and gives worse fuel economy than a
smaller engine, everything else being equal.&nbsp; Larger, more powerful
gasoline engines also work at a smaller percentage of potential power, forcing
them to work under a greater intake manifold vacuum (because the throttle is
mostly closed) and increasing pumping energy losses.</p>
<p>Turbodiesels all use turbocharging, the third method of making more power by compressing the air.&nbsp; The goal
of compressing the air is to make a denser air charge which increases volumetric
efficiency (getting more power out of a given volume of engine).&nbsp;
Unfortunately, turbocharging also makes the air hotter through compression and
radiant heat, which expands the air charge (air increases in volume as it gets
hotter), contradicting the goal of maximum density.&nbsp; A well designed turbocharged car
will use an intercooler (a heat sink cooled with ambient air or water/coolant) to
cool the air as much as possible, maximizing air density.&nbsp; They are placed downstream of the
turbo because that's where the air absorbs most of the heat.&nbsp; An air intercooler cannot cool
the air charge further than ambient air.&nbsp; You also don't see intercoolers on
non-turbo cars because the intake air is already at ambient temperature.&nbsp; An air intake directly connected to an intercooler or
anywhere not after the turbo would actually decrease performance by restricting
airflow.&nbsp; Below is a funny picture of an &quot;interfooler&quot;, a non
functional intercooler on a non turbo car, in the middle of installation.&nbsp;
They installed it because they think
it looks cool but it shows ignorance of how an intercooler is supposed to work.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/interfooler.jpg" width="540" height="367"></p>
<p>Because an engine is basically an air pump, it's also helpful to know the path air takes as it
goes through a turbocharged diesel engine.&nbsp; Here is a basic explanation:
first, air enters through the air filter box.&nbsp;
It then goes into the intake side of the turbocharger where it gets compressed and heated,
and then piped through the intercooler.&nbsp; It cools and becomes denser in the
intercooler and then
goes into the intake manifold.&nbsp; Air then passes through the cylinder head, which
contains the intake and exhaust valves, and into the combustion cylinders.&nbsp; The
intake valves shut, sealing the combustion chamber. The engine piston moves up
and compresses the charge.&nbsp; Very high pressure fuel is sprayed into
the combustion chamber which cools the air charge further.&nbsp; In a gasoline
engine, a spark plug ignites the charge.&nbsp; In a diesel engine, the air/fuel charge
combusts as it's injected due to the high compression.&nbsp; The combustion pushes the piston
down which turns the crankshaft.&nbsp; The exhaust
valve opens and lets the exhaust gas out the exhaust side of the
cylinder head, through the exhaust side of the turbo, and out the exhaust
pipe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> When the piston is pushed down during combustion, the crankshaft
turns.&nbsp; This energy is transmitted to the transmission which turns the
driveaxles, which turns the wheels.</p>
<p>The turbo is powered by exhaust gas, scavenging exhaust energy that would
otherwise be wasted by going out the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; A basic turbo has a compressor side, a turbine side,
and a center housing.&nbsp; After going out the engine, the exhaust gas goes
into the turbine side of the turbo, spinning the turbine wheel, then going out
the exhaust.&nbsp; A center housing contains bearings and a shaft connecting the
compressor and turbine wheel.&nbsp; That energy from the turbine turns the
shaft, which turns the compressor wheel, which compresses the intake air...then
the cycle repeats.&nbsp; If there is too much pressure build up, a gas wastegate on the turbine side lets excess exhaust gas out.&nbsp;
Some modern turbos relieve the excess gas pressure by changing the angle that
the gasses are directed at the turbo
wheels.&nbsp; For more technical
information regarding turbocharging, read <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000

<h3>Gasoline - Diesel engine differences</h3>
<p>Among the biggest differences between gasoline and diesel engines are fuel and
construction.&nbsp; Diesel engines compress the air in a ratio, on average, of
19:1.&nbsp; Compression ratios on gasoline average 9:1-11:1.&nbsp; The static
compression of a diesel engine is about
400-550 psi where a gasoline engine produces about 160-180 psi.&nbsp; Never
use a gasoline engine compression tester on a diesel engine because it will
probably break the gauge!&nbsp;
The peak combustion pressures when the engine is burning fuel can
reach 1000-1500 psi in a gasoline engine and 2000-3000 in a diesel
engine.</p>
<p>Not only does higher compression result in better fuel economy, it causes the
diesel fuel/air mixture to autoignite in micro explosions when injected into the
engine.&nbsp; Gasoline burns
with a flame front starting when the spark plug ignites the fuel/air
mixture.&nbsp; A gasoline can rev higher partially due to the limits of how fast diesel fuel can cleanly burn.&nbsp;
Gasoline vapors can also easily ignite from spilled fuel in a car crash or while
pouring gas into a spare can (from a static electricity spark).&nbsp; Diesel vapors don't <u>easily</u>
ignite at room temperature/pressure from an open flame since its flash point is at about
64<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; Biodiesel's flash point is about 130<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; An example of this is
shown at the 1:00 minute mark in the video below.&nbsp; Don't try to replicate the
experiment shown!&nbsp; This higher resistance is one reason diesel was used in
tanks and military vehicles.&nbsp; Some still use diesel in modern turbine
powered tanks.<br>

<p>Here are some pictures of a gasoline engine piston (left) and a diesel engine
piston (right).&nbsp; In most gasoline engines, the piston face is often flat because
the space above it acts as the combustion chamber.&nbsp; There are some pistons
with dome or roof shaped tops, but the picture below is typical of most gasoline
pistons.&nbsp; The air/fuel mixture is also mixed outside of the cylinders in most gasoline engines.</p>
<p> VW TDI diesel pistons (pictured below) has a bowl into which the
fuel is sprayed and swirls into.&nbsp; That bowl acts as the combustion chamber due to the
need for higher compression.&nbsp; The face of the piston nearly touches the
cylinder head while the engine is running.&nbsp; Some older diesel engines have the bowl in the cylinder
head and a flat piston but this type is standard for modern TDI engines.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/gaspiston.jpg" width="255" height="227">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../images/dpiston.jpg" width="195" height="221"></p>
<p>Because a diesel engine has much higher compression and pressure than a
gasoline engine, they are also typically built with more forged metal parts and
sturdier construction than gasoline engines which are built mostly with cast metal parts.&nbsp;
Forging means the metal is &quot;stamped&quot; and formed under pressure to make the metal denser,
stronger, and &quot;better formed&quot; on a microscopic level.&nbsp; Diesel cars have many cast parts and some gasoline cars have
many forged parts, so the exact construction
really varies
from car model to model.&nbsp; Casting metal by pouring molten metal into a mold is a cheaper,
faster, and easier way to form metal.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an example, the mk6 VW Jetta
TDI weighs about 125 lbs heavier than the 2.5L engine gasoline Jetta.&nbsp; Part
of the extra weight is from the turbo, intercooler, piping, and emissions
treatments, so I'm guessing the 2.0L 4 cylinder TDI engine weighs about 80 lbs
more than the 2.5L 5 cylinder gas engine.</p>
<p> A
downside
of a diesel's sturdier construction is that the parts have more mass and cannot
move as quickly as lighter gasoline engine parts.&nbsp; This is mostly due to
beefier construction and not necessarily due to forged parts.&nbsp; Heavier
components in a diesel engine limit how high the engine
can rev before the engine parts
decide to fail and scatter.&nbsp; The other main reason is the burning properties of diesel
fuel.&nbsp; While forged metal parts are stronger, a limitation is the slightly different rates at which forged and
cast metal parts expand from heat due to the forging process and the metals
used.&nbsp; Generally speaking, aftermarket forged pistons will expand more than
OEM forged pistons because they're used in tuner engines and engineering
limitations.&nbsp; While quality control can be higher, engineering can't
compare to the amount of work that an OEM
engine sees.&nbsp; Also, if someone switches to aftermarket forged pistons, they
did so because they need a looser fit to expand from higher heat and pressure
that the performance engine will see in racing conditions.&nbsp; Once they heat up and expand,
it closes the clearances and the stronger forged
piston can tolerate greater stresses than a comparable cast
piston.&nbsp; The big advantage of using a cast piston is that it is cheaper and
easier to make, less vulnerable to cold engine start abuse, and works fine for
OEM applications.&nbsp; As a result, even though most gasoline and diesel turbocharged passenger
cars have forged crankshafts and connecting rods, most
of them use cast pistons, for the aforementioned reasons and economy.<br>
<br>
All modern diesel engines also use direct fuel injection (DFI or DI).&nbsp; DFI
engines spray fuel directly into the hot combustion cylinder.&nbsp; Various manufacturers
may call it pumpe duse, CDI, or common rail - these are just different methods
and brand names of DI.&nbsp; Most gasoline engines
spray fuel into the
intake manifold or ports.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> Not only does DFI reduce emissions from a more complete burn (finer fuel
atomization), it also lets you compress the air more (greater compression ratio
= more power and efficiency) due to greater resistance to detonation.&nbsp; DFI cools down the engine by
the latent heat of fuel vaporization further helps prevent detonation because
the fuel isn't injected until right before the spark plug ignites it.&nbsp; Some gasoline turbo direct injection cars also time the opening and closing of the
exhaust valves to create a small extra draft to help spin the turbo without
burning up the exhaust valves or turbo.&nbsp; Direct injection lets these cars
use some valve overlap and still meet emissions standards because of great control over fuel injection.&nbsp;&nbsp;By
not injecting fuel during valve overlap no fuel is wasted or is released as
excess emissions.</p>
<p>In addition to higher compression, diesel engines are not throttled by air,
they are throttled by fuel.&nbsp; Because they're always running air through
them, they can run in a very lean (low fuel) state which conserves fuel.</p>
<p>The biggest difference between DFI in older VW and Audi diesels, newer pumpe
duse, and common rail DI is the fuel pressure and control over the fuel
injection events.&nbsp;
See <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">1000q:
direct injection vs pumpe duse vs common rail</a> for more details.&nbsp;&nbsp;Older
direct injection sprayed a shot of fuel into the cylinders at about 3300
psi.&nbsp; Pumpe duse compresses the fuel to a much
higher pressure of about 27,000 psi.&nbsp; Common rail DI uses multiple small, then large shots of fuel
sprayed out of piezoelectric fuel injectors and is quickly becoming the new
standard in diesel engines due to very precise control over fuel injection.&nbsp;
Unlike earlier TDI, the timing of the fuel injection in common rail is independent of the
cam or timing belt.&nbsp; Common rail TDI engines were introduced to North
America in the <a href="a5/2009-2010-VW-Jetta-TDI-checklist.htm">2009 VW Jetta
TDI</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A diesel engine also uses glow plugs to preheat the cylinders on cold engine
starts.&nbsp; On a gasoline engine, spark plugs are in about the same position
in the cylinder head but are not analogous to glow plugs since they ignite the fuel/air
charge, glow plugs only preheat the cylinder.</p>
<p>A diesel engine should also use diesel specific engine oils.&nbsp; These oils
are designed to control and contain the soot of diesel engine.&nbsp;
Gasoline specific engine oils have different specifications&nbsp; A list of
diesel specific engine oils can be found here:&nbsp; <a href="engineoilNP.htm">1000q:
1996-2003 TDI engine oil</a> or <a href="engineoilpump.htm">1000q: 2004-2006 TDI
engine oil</a>.&nbsp; The 2009+ Jetta TDI uses VW/Audi spec 507.00 oil.&nbsp;
There is
not enough information for aftermarket oils in the 2009+ yet so I suggest
sticking to the manufacturer's specification of VW
spec 507.00 oil.</p>

<h3>The transmission</h3>
<p>A transmission is a series of gears and other parts to transmit the energy
produced from the car's engine to the drive wheels of the car.&nbsp; Because it
is too complicated to discuss every detail of the transmission, this section
will focus on the basic mechanics, operation and maintenance of the
transmission.&nbsp;If you want to know the details of how a transmission works,
there is a good article on the site &quot;How stuff works&quot; which has lots of good
pictures.&nbsp; I've written an article on how the DSG transmission works
because it's specific to the TDI and VW/Audi, see <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
DSG FAQ</a>.&nbsp; To see specifics on how the clutch works, see <a href="clutch-kit-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
clutch FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, the transmission transmits the energy of the engine, which
operates from idle to 5000rpm in VW diesels, to the car's wheels, which operates between 0 and
2500rpm.&nbsp; In your front wheel drive VW, it's called a transaxle because it
combines the transmission and transaxle in one piece.&nbsp; It also sits
sideways so that the output shafts point at the front wheels.&nbsp; The biggest difference between a diesel and gasoline transmission
is the
rpm range for which it is geared because of the operating rpm of the engine.&nbsp;
Here's a video showing some more explanation.&nbsp; It's not a TDI transaxle but
the basic explanation is the same.<br>
<object width="425" height="344"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzYGcDZXgWQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vzYGcDZXgWQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="425" height="344"></embed></object>

<p>An automatic transmission is very different from a manual
transmission.&nbsp; Inside the auto trans is a torque converter, a hydraulic
fluid coupling that looks like a propeller and transmits the engine energy
to the rest of the transmission, which then drives the wheels.&nbsp; If you want
to see pictures, refer to &quot;How stuff works&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; A recent trend in auto
transmissions is &quot;lifetime&quot; fluid.&nbsp; If you go to the dealership,
they may tell you that your car has lifetime fluid and is not serviceable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I think what they mean is that when the fluid breaks down and the transmission
becomes rough or worn, it ends the economically useful lifetime of your car, so come back
and buy a new car.&nbsp; Lifetime might also mean the lifetime of your
car's warranty.&nbsp; There is no such thing as fluid that has an infinite life.&nbsp;
In theory, lifetime fluids could last anywhere between 50,000 mi and 500,000 mi
without issue.&nbsp; The problem is that it gets contaminated with water, new
car break-in debris, age related debris, faulty auto transmission filters, or leaks/seeps out.&nbsp; Here is a picture of a &quot;lifetime&quot;
fluid's filter pan from an Audi A8 with lifetime fill.&nbsp; Those are metal
shavings stuck to a magnet and changing the fluid will at least greatly extend
the life of the car.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/b5/drivlne/transpanmagnet.jpg" width="587" height="445"></p>
<p> Even being very conservative/frugal, a fluid
change every 60-80,000 mi or 5 years is not asking a lot and doesn't cost very much
per mile considering how long the
service interval is.&nbsp; For your car, refer to your owner's manual or find
your model's how to article on changing the ATF in <a href="../1000q.htm">1000
answered questions: index.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A manual transmission uses gear oil, not ATF fluid, so do not mix auto transmission
fluids and manual gear oil. A manual transmission has a pressure plate attached
to the flywheel with a clutch sandwiched in between.&nbsp; When you step on the
clutch pedal, you release the pressure plate's clamp on the clutch and disengage
the engine from the transmission. All modern passenger manual transmissions are
synchronized, they use &quot;rings or cones&quot; which match the speed of the gears.&nbsp; If
your synchronizers are worn out due to poor shifting technique, defect, or lack
of maintenance, the gears will not be &quot;matched&quot; and will grind.&nbsp;
For a better description of a manual transmission with pictures, see &quot;How stuff
works&quot;.&nbsp; Fluid should be changed according to your car's service
interval, refer to the your model's detailed specs in <a href="../buyersguide.htm">1000q:
buyers guide</a> for more information on change intervals or <a href="../1000q.htm">1000
answered questions: index.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DSG transmission is a dual clutch automatically shifted manual-like
transmission.&nbsp; It is not anything like a conventional torque converter
automatic transmission.&nbsp; The advantages are ease of use and better performance than a
conventional automatic.&nbsp; However, it may give lower mileage and as a group,
give lower reliability than a manual transmission.&nbsp; See a detailed
description at <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: DSG FAQ</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a lot of confusion about which manual transmission gear oil brand to
use.&nbsp; Refer to your owner's manual for the most precise answer.&nbsp; Older
VW transmissions should only use a GL-4 gear oil, not a GL-5 gear oil which
includes Mobil 1 75-90.&nbsp; Many people have success with Redline MTL or MT
90, or Royal Purple Max gear.&nbsp; VW often changes and contradicts itself on
the official spec oil, so try a few different GL-4 oils and see which results in
the best shifting and transmission feel for you.</p>
