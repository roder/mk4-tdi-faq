<h1>VW  and Audi TDI fuel injection systems 1996-present</h1>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>

<p> This article shows the 3 basic types of direct injection diesel fuel injection used in TDI
engines sold in North America:  - the Bosch VE type injection pump, pumpe
duse unit injector, and common rail diesel (CRD).&nbsp; Engine generations in Volkswagen TDI didn't always change with body
generations. Direct injection systems inject fuel directly into the combustion chamber instead of into a pre
combustion chamber or intake manifold. To keep it simple, this article focuses only on the
basic differences in fuel injection.&nbsp; Cars outside of North America may
have gotten some of these technologies before or after North America.&nbsp; See the FAQ button linked above to see a full list of DIY, &quot;how to&quot;
specific to your car, and more general diesel FAQ.</p>
<p>Here is a quick summary of each generation. A detailed description is below.</p>

<h2>1996-2003 VW TDI</h2>

<p>TDI  was first introduced in the 1989 Audi 100 5 cylinder 120hp TDI engine but North
American didn't see TDI until 1996.&nbsp; The 1996-1997 Passat and some 1997 Jetta use the 1Z
engine.&nbsp; The 1997-1999 Jetta use the AHU engine (same pistons and rods as
the newer ALH engines).&nbsp; Since 1997 was a
transition year for the TDI engine, most 97 should have 1Z but some late builds might have
AHU engines. These cars were never 50 state emissions legal - you couldn't buy them new in states with CA emissions standards, you could only buy them used.</p>
<p>These engines share the basic engine layout with
  earlier VW 4 cylinder engines. They all use the Bosch VE VP 37 type
  rotary electronic fuel injection pump.&nbsp; VE stands for verteilier, German
  for distributor.&nbsp; VP 37  is the model.&nbsp; The pump distributes fuel to the
  injectors using a rotary pump instead of an inline pump used on many diesels.&nbsp; The injection
  pump is driven by a sprocket off the timing belt.&nbsp; There were many models of Bosch injection
  pumps; TDI pumps are all electronically controlled and most can be modified to fit on any 1996-2003 TDI.&nbsp; See <a href="a3b4/injection-pump-alh-swap-repair-tdi.htm">1000q:
    IP conversion</a> for details on how to modify the ALH pump to fit on an older
  car.</p>
<p>In 1998, VW introduced the new ALH engine in the New Beetle (98-99 Jetta still
  used the AHU).&nbsp; Manual transmission cars with the
  ALH engine are still the most fuel efficient and most reliable TDI.&nbsp; 1998-99 New Beetle and
  all 1999.5-2003 New Beetle, Golf, and Jetta use
  the ALH engine.&nbsp; See <a href="a4/new-owner-checklist-VW-TDI-mk4.htm">1000q: early
mk4 buying checklist</a> for a guide on what to look for on these cars.</p>

<h2>2004-2006 TDI&nbsp;</h2>

<p>These are all
pumpe duse (PD), a new type of direct injection.&nbsp; It had been used in European
TDI for a while before coming to North America.&nbsp; Check out the <a href="mk4%20cos_diff.htm">cosmetic
differences between mk4 pumpe duse and non-pumpe duse Jetta</a> to help identify
what car you have (2004-2005 Passat TDI, BHW engine, and Touareg V10 TDI are all
PD). The change to PD was to meet newer emissions standards.</p>

<p>PD engines have significant
mechanical differences from the earlier non-pumpe duse cars.&nbsp; 2004-2006 4th generation cars
use the BEW engine (2004-2006 Golf/New Beetle) and 5th generation cars use the
BRM engine (2005.5-2006 5th generation Jetta TDI).&nbsp; The difference is
because the Jetta changed over to the 5th gen in 2005.5.&nbsp; All PD use a low pressure electric fuel pump
(about 6-8 psi) in the fuel
tank, something that earlier TDI did not.&nbsp; For a buying checklist for the
early pumpe duse engines, see <a href="a4/new-owner-checklist-VW-TDI-mk4.htm">1000q:
pumpe duse engine checklist</a>.&nbsp; For the A5 body pumpe duse, see <a href="a5/2005-2006-VW-Jetta-TDI-buying-guide.htm">1000q:
early A5 Jetta TDI buying checklist</a>.</p>

<h2> 2009 + 4 cylinder TDI</h2>

<p>These use common rail  engines which 
saw major changes.&nbsp;Common rail runs cleaner and more powerful but since it's a new technology, has had some reliability and teething issues in both diesel and gasoline cars. The change to common rail was  to meet 50 state and Euro emissions standards. Because of greater advertising/awareness, supply, and higher fuel prices, these TDI are by far, the most common.</p>
<p>While the 2009-2010 Jetta sedan uses the same body as the 2005.5-2006 Jetta,
  it has a completely different engine/transmission and emissions control system. The engines were the CJAA and CBEA for North America.&nbsp; Again, body style does not necessarily follow engine model for all TDI.
  The 2010 Audi A3 is the first TDI passenger car that Audi has sold in North
  America (they were sold in Europe for years).&nbsp; It uses the same common rail engine found in the newest
  Golf/Jetta TDI.&nbsp; To see more details on the 2010 Audi A3, see <a href="8p/2010-2011-audi-a3-TDI-checklist.htm">1000q:
    Audi A3 TDI buying checklist</a>.</p>
<p>The 2012 Passat TDI uses what I call &quot;version 1.5 &quot; of this generation of common rail engines. While retaining many basic characteristics, the CKRA engine on the Passat uses a different fuel pump,  fuel injectors, turbo, and air-water intercooler like the V2.0 mk7 engines. Fuel pump failure is not yet noticeable except a few random failures but  long term reliabilty after high miles is still unknown.</p>
<h2>2009 + 6 cylinder VW Touareg TDI, Audi Q7 TDI, and Porsche Cayenne diesel</h2>

<p>These also use common rail but in a V6 engine longitudinal TDI engine and with AWD. While many of the basic principles of fuel injection apply
to these larger V6 engines, the engine itself is very different.&nbsp; See <a href="V6-TDI-engine-FAQ.htm">1000q:
CATA engine FAQ</a> to learn some basics about the V6 TDI engine.&nbsp; The
major difference to the end user is much more power, availability with AWD
quattro, and that these all use urea solution injection into the
exhaust to meet emissions standards (see the below videos).</p>
<h2>2013+ European Golf, 2015+ North American Golf/JSW wagons</h2>
<p>These use version 2.0 of the common rail engines. The core engine  is a new generation, the  EA888. Major differences are integrated balance shaft, variable cooling and oiling, air-water intercooler, separate cooling loops for the head/block, and major parts revisions. The air-water intercooler fixes the intercooler ice problem and the variable cooling lets the car warm up faster. Long term reliability is unknown since it's a new design.</p>
<p><b>The myth of the heated fuel filter</b></p>
<p>A common misunderstanding on all generations of TDI is
  that they had electrically heated fuel filters.&nbsp; No TDI was ever equipped
  with an electrically heated fuel filter from the factory.&nbsp; All but a few
  early 1998 New Beetle TDI had fuel filters that were warmed a little bit by the return line
  fuel.&nbsp; When fuel returns from the engine it's warmed by radiant
  heat coming off the engine and from pressurization.&nbsp; When it's cold, the warmed return
  line fuel is recirculated through the fuel filter and back to the engine to help
  warm up and prevent fuel gelling.&nbsp; If the fuel gets too warm a thermostatic T bypass sends it back to the fuel tank.</p>
<p>There were a few TDI in Europe that came factory equipped with coolant heated fuel filter adapters. These used engine coolant to warm a sandwich heater element above the fuel filter as shown below. They can only be used with certain screw-on fuel filter styles. If you wish to add a heated fuel filter, it's cheaper/easier to loop a coolant hose around the fuel filter or use a stick-on  electric blanket type heater.<br>

<h3>Bosch VE pump direct injection, not pumpe duse, 1996-2003</h3>

<p>If your engine cover looks like one of these (mk3 on left, mk4 on right), this is what you have.<font size="4"><b><br>
</b></font><img src="../images/tdi-engine-cover.jpg" width="1168" height="344"><br>
</p>
<p>These engines use  the Bosch VE VP 37 fuel injection pump.&nbsp; There is no electric fuel pump anywhere on these
cars.&nbsp; The fuel is drawn from the fuel tank
under low pressure suction by
the injection pump and pressurized by the injection pump to over 3300 psi at the
injector.&nbsp; Try to think of the injection pump more like a pressure wave generator than
a simple water wheel type pump.&nbsp; Timing of the injection
pump sprocket is very important.&nbsp; This is a common cause of timing belt job
mistakes, engine running issues, and no start problems.&nbsp; See the full list of how to linked at the top to find the timing
belt &quot;how to&quot; for your engine.&nbsp; The great pressure generated at the
injector is created by restricting and focusing the wave down  into a small tip, the injector
nozzle.</p>
<p>Each fuel injector is a spring loaded, 2-stage, 5 port injector.&nbsp; All engines are water cooled, 4 cylinder, 8
  valve inline engines.&nbsp; Here is a cutaway of a direct injection fuel
  injector.&nbsp; Note the 2 stage injection - a pilot injection before the main injection
      softens the pressure waves of combustion and signal the start of injection
to the needle lift sensor. The main injection occurs around 3190-3335 psi.&nbsp; The springs close the nozzle when the fuel pressure inside the injector
drops.&nbsp;Please refer to <a href="multi/TDI-nozzle-FAQ.htm">1000q:
    TDI nozzle and injector FAQ</a> for detailed technical information and <a href="multi/nozzle-install-TDI.htm">1000q:

replace the fuel injector tips (nozzles).<br>

All cars are rated for about:
      <p>(mk3 cars)<br>
      HP: 90 @ 4000rpm<br>
      Torque (ft lbs): 149 @ 1900rpm</p>

      HP: 90 @ 3750rpm<br>
      Torque (ft lbs): 155 @ 1900rpm</p>
      <p>Here is a video explaining the basics of how this type of hole injector
  works.&nbsp; It's not specific to TDI but gives you an idea of the spring-fuel
  pressure relationship.&nbsp; You can also see how there's some fuel that is not
  injected and is carried away.&nbsp; This fuel helps cool the injector and nozzle
by carrying away heat.&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Pumpe Duse injection TDI 2004-2006</h3>

<p>If your car is a 2004-2006 VW TDI and was sold in North America, it has a pumpe duse engine.&nbsp;
This includes all Jetta, New Beetle, Golf, Passat, and Touareg TDI.&nbsp; The
most noticeable change is the pumpe duse injectors and lack of a timing belt
driven Bosch VE fuel injection pump.&nbsp; If you have a mk4 Jetta/Golf/Beetle engine cover
that looks like the one below you have pumpe duse.&nbsp; 2004-2008 Jetta, Passat, and
Touareg TDI sold in North America were all pumpe duse.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/bew-engine-cover.jpg" width="700" height="350"></p>
<p>Pumpe duse is VW and Audi's brand name for unit injector technology.&nbsp;
Each injector is actually a miniature fuel pump - pumpe duse is roughly
translated as pump nozzle.&nbsp; Unlike earlier
TDI which had no electric fuel pump anywhere, pumpe duse cars use a low pressure (about
5-10psi)
electric pump in the fuel tank, called a lift pump, to move fuel to
the engine.&nbsp; A medium pressure fuel pump at the engine
called the tandem pump, (also a vacuum system pump) at the end of the camshaft pressurizes fuel to 50-110+ psi into the 
fuel rail inside the cylinder head. Fuel enters each injector and when  actuated by the camshaft, pressurizes the
fuel up to 27,846 psi. The fuel spray is  carefully timed by electric solenoid.&nbsp; The high stress
on the camshaft and fuel injector is partly why VW recommends that pumpe duse cars use engine oil approved
by VW for pumpe duse engines.&nbsp; Refer to: <a href="engineoilpump.htm">1000q: pumpe duse engine oil</a> for a list of some of the approved oils
which are available in
North America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike earlier cars, both
manual and auto transmissions cars use a fuel cooler in the front of the car due
to the higher temperatures that the pumpe duse system puts into the return line
fuel.</p>

<p>The camshaft has an additional four lobes over the
older engines to actuate the pumpe duse injectors.&nbsp; Because these take up
room, the camshaft valve lobes are narrower than in the past.&nbsp; A very common issue is worn camshaft lobes.&nbsp;If the engine sounds very poor at idle and is suffering from running issues, it probably has  camshaft wear. 
See <a href="multi/camshaft-inspection-replace-vw-tdi.htm">1000q:
pumpe duse camshaft inspection</a> for more details. The only other  reliability issue specific to this type of engine is ovaled injector bores (very rare issue). All PD engines will put a little soot into the fuel, turning the fuel filter black quickly, but excess could indicate compression leaking through the injector bores.</p>
<p>Aside
  from the fuel injection differences, the engine components are also different.&nbsp; Due to higher piston
  pressures, the pistons are heavier, have a smaller wrist pin, and do not
  have impressions for the valve heads like earlier pistons.&nbsp; They also feature
  slightly stronger
  connecting rods and bigger rod bearings.&nbsp; All engines are still water cooled and 4 inline cylinders but
  the Volkswagen Passat engines are now slightly different than other TDI.&nbsp; The
  Passat engine is
  a 2.0L, 8 valve longitudinal engine and uses different components than the 1.9L 8
  valve engines.&nbsp; Note: although sales brochures list the VW Passat as 16v, the
  16v engine was never imported to the North American market.&nbsp; The 16v engine was only available in Europe. Many Passat
  TDI have had faulty chain drives and have had the oil pump assembly replaced with a gear driven
  assembly.&nbsp; See <a href="b5/oil-pump-failure-passat-tdi.htm">1000q: Passat
    TDI oil pump chain FAQ</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Below left is a cutaway of a pumpe duse injector.&nbsp; Below right is a
  diagram of the injector in the cylinder head - the fuel rail is built into the
  cylinder head.&nbsp; Big changes vs. past injectors are in the valve spring like top
  which is actuated by the camshaft, the side feed fuel injectors, and the
solenoid injection action.</p>

<h3>Common Rail TDI fuel injection 2009 - 2011 and newer</h3>

<p> Every 2009 or newer Volkswagen or Audi TDI sold in North America uses the common rail
engine.&nbsp; Here's the VW and Audi A3 TDI engine covers as a quick reference.<br>
<img src="../images/crd-cover.jpg" width="891" height="283"><br>
</p>
<p>Volkswagen switched to all common rail engines in 2009 for North American to
  meet emissions standards.&nbsp; Their marketing materials  state that they
  were meeting demands for quieter, more powerful engines but it came down to
  meeting emissions.&nbsp; Older engines cannot meet modern emissions standards. The Jetta/Golf TDI use engine code CBEA or CJAA, a 4 cylinder transverse
  turbodiesel with 140hp, 236lb-ft torque. The Touareg/Audi Q7 TDI use engine
  code CATA, a V6 longitudinal turbodiesel.&nbsp; This page focuses on the 4 cylinnder engines - see <a href="V6-TDI-engine-FAQ.htm">1000q: CATA FAQ</a> for details on the
V6 engine.</p>

<p>They use the same low pressure in tank electric fuel pump as the pumpe duse
to pressurize fuel to about 5 psi from the fuel tank.&nbsp; It then goes to a
medium pressure pump above the passenger side motor mount to be pressurized to
about 73 psi.&nbsp; This is about what gasoline fuel tank pumps run at.&nbsp; It
then goes to the high pressure fuel pump (HPFP). The HPFP pressurizes diesel fuel up to 26,107 psi (1800 bar) in an &quot;accumulator rail&quot;,
shown below on a CBEA engine, a common tube/rail shared by all of
the fuel injectors.&nbsp; Unlike most common rail systems which are made by
suppliers, VW makes the common rail themselves.&nbsp; (Bosch makes the fuel
pump).&nbsp; Fuel is metered at the pump but a fuel pressure
regulator valve on the right end of the rail also controls fuel pressure in the rail by
bleeding off pressure.&nbsp; Pressure is a byproduct of restriction so by
closing the bleed valve, fuel entering the rail has nowhere to go and becomes pressurized.<br>
<img src="../images/a6/engine/crd-injector-2.jpg" width="949" height="500"></p>

<p>There have been a few reports of  HPFP failure (sometimes repeated) which sends metal flakes into the fuel system. This causes severe damage to it, requiring replacement of the fuel injectors, valves, pump, and filters. The fuel rail, tank, and lines must also be throughly cleaned.&nbsp;
  Since only VW-Audi and Bosch know the real numbers and causes of failure, we can only speculate on possible causes which include faulty manufacturing, a weak design, defective parts, low quality fuel, or contaminated fuel including  gasoline in the diesel.&nbsp; See <a href="a5/2009-2010-VW-TDI-fuel-filter.htm">1000q:
    fuel filter inspection</a> for a basic check to see if there are flakes in the
  fuel system.<br>
</p>

<p>The big advantage of modern common rail systems are their piezoelectric fuel
injectors.&nbsp; They offer much better control over fuel injection quantity and
duration then the older spring type fuel injectors or solenoid and camshaft
drive pumpe duse injectors.&nbsp; Unlike older systems, they can inject fuel totally independent of cam
timing.&nbsp; Piezoelectric injectors use a type of piezoelectric crystal that expands in response
to electrical voltage instead of electromagnetic solenoids
like pumpe duse injectors.&nbsp; The crystals can switch in a few thousands of a second, 4-5 times
faster than a solenoid.&nbsp; The expansion of the crystal moves the nozzle
needle.&nbsp; The needle can also be made with about 75% less mass.&nbsp; The effect of these
faster, more precise injections is quieter, more
powerful, and cleaner combustion.&nbsp; By injecting small quantities of fuel before the main injection,
it smoothes out the pressure waves created by diesel combustion, thus quieting and
smoothing out engine vibrations.&nbsp; Older injectors had only a pilot and
main injection while piezoelectric fuel injectors can have up to 5
injections per stroke.&nbsp; This results in a smoother and quieter engine.&nbsp; The common rail injectors also feature 8 holes, which lets the
same amount of fuel be injected in a finer mist, which also increases fuel economy and
power.</p>

<p> Switching from 8 valve to 16 valve cylinder
heads and better fuel atomization from common rail diesel injection (CRD) let
the cars achieve a cleaner burn compared to earlier cars.&nbsp; New emissions treatments catch what is left over, making the car 50 state emissions
legal.&nbsp; Smaller 4 cylinder Golf Jetta TDI
use post injection combustion instead of adblue fluid for emissions treatments.</p>

<p> The
Mercedes Benz common rail engines have been using this technology for a while
but were not 50 US state legal due to emissions.&nbsp;
Generally speaking, the 6 cylinder common rail diesel engines sold in the US
like the BMW 335d, MB bluetecs, and VW/Audi TDI w/V6 engines use urea injection to meet
emissions.&nbsp; Part of the reason why the 4 cylinder VWs don't use urea injection because
the engines are smaller and don't have to burn more fuel to move larger, heavier cars.&nbsp; Here is a
video explaining the emissions treatments with Adblue urea injection on a
VW/Audi.<br>
<object width="560" height="340"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/bgusjGRP3XQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/bgusjGRP3XQ&hl=en&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="560" height="340"></embed></object></p>

<p>The smaller Jetta and Golf
engines use the
fuel injectors to squirt a
little bit of fuel after the main combustion to burn up trapped particulates in
the exhaust system during an active regeneration self clean cycle.&nbsp; This regeneration occurs about every
400-700 miles depending on driving style, use, and how clogged the filter is.&nbsp;
Some particulates get burned off naturally during from normal driving.  See <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
DPF and CRD emissions FAQ</a> for more details on the system.</p>

<p>Another big engine change for the US is dual camshafts.&nbsp; The
timing belt drives the exhaust cam and the intake cam is gear driven by the
exhaust cam. &nbsp;The intake manifold is now in front of the engine instead
behind and the exhaust manifold points up instead of down.&nbsp; The
engine will also have pressure sensing glow plugs.&nbsp; The common rail engine uses
a gear driven oil pump.&nbsp; The engine also uses a higher turbo boost than earlier engines.&nbsp; The
CBEA engine uses about 22 psi of boost.</p>
