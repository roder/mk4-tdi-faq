<h3><a name="where">Where is the EGR on your VW or Audi TDI and what does it do?</a></h3>
<p> EGR stands for Exhaust Gas Recirculation.&nbsp; The system is located on
the firewall side (rear) of the engine on almost all TDI engines.&nbsp; The main
purpose of the EGR is to reduce NOx emissions produced during diesel or gasoline engine combustion.</p>
<p> By mixing
exhaust gasses back into the engine, it lowers peak combustion temperatures and
reduces NOx emissions anywhere from 50%-75% vs. a non-EGR system.&nbsp; The
newest 2009+ models work with the exhaust or Adblue system to reduce NOx even
further.&nbsp; The reason why putting exhaust gas
(hotter
than ambient air) into the intake stream reduces NOx is because the free oxygen
would otherwise turn into NOx during combustion.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because a diesel runs very lean (much
more air than fuel for efficiency), there's more oxygen present vs. a gasoline
engine which means more NOx.&nbsp;
The MAF air intake sensor also sees a reduction in air intake and adjusts fueling.&nbsp;
Everything else being equal and within limits, in a diesel, more fuel = more
power = higher temperatures (more potential for NOx formation).&nbsp; In a gasoline car, more fuel at the right
ratios = lower temperatures.</p>
<p> The 1997-2003 1.9L TDI systems take in exhaust gases at
the exhaust manifold, send them through the EGR cooler (except <a href="a3b4/clean-intake-manifold-tdi.htm">
North American market 1996 passat</a>), and then into the intake manifold through the EGR
valve at the intake manifold.&nbsp; The 2004-2006 EGR system takes in gas at the
exhaust manifold, sends it through a diverter valve, then the EGR cooler, then
through the EGR/diverter valve into the intake manifold.&nbsp; These later cars
used an electronic EGR and intake flap
&quot;throttles&quot; that regulate intake air for EGR metering purposes.&nbsp;
Unlike a gasoline car, the throttle has no direct role in controlling engine RPM
- it's only for the EGR because all diesel engines are throttled by fueling, not
air.&nbsp; Earlier cars used a vacuum and solenoid operated
EGR.&nbsp; These are standard routings in most cars,
both diesel and gasoline, turbo and non turbo.&nbsp; The newest
engines have a high and low pressure filtered EGR system that works with the diesel particulate
filter DPF system.&nbsp; See <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: DPF FAQ</a> for more details on the newest
2.0L engines.&nbsp; For the 3.0L TDI engine, see <a href="vw-touareg-tdi-dpf-audi-q7.htm">1000q:
3.0L emissions system and Adblue fluid FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>The system is regulated by
the car's computer to open or close to varying degrees depending on load and
other factors.&nbsp;
At light load or idle, up to 30% of the intake air flow can be recirculated
exhaust.&nbsp; At
heavier loads, the EGR valve begins to close and at a certain point, the car's
computer closes the EGR valve completely.&nbsp; In the newest common rail TDI engines
(2009+), the EGR closes all the way during an active diesel particulate filter
regeneration cycle.&nbsp; Since the EGR is opened and
closed at various engine loads, the presence or absence of the EGR does not have
a significant effect on engine longevity.&nbsp; In theory, it lowers
temperatures at lighter loads where there is less fueling and lower cylinder
temperatures.&nbsp; In most cars, at heavy loads with more fueling and higher temperatures,
the EGR system is closed so it does not reduce peak power at all.&nbsp; Again,
because diesels run so lean, there's plenty of oxygen to burn even at high EGR
flow.</p>
<p>Before going into the engine, exhaust gasses normally pass through a
cooler.&nbsp; A side benefit of an EGR cooler is faster engine warm up because the hot exhaust
gasses give their heat to the coolant.&nbsp; This is great for a diesel because
cold engines have greater engine wear, worse fuel economy, and emissions.&nbsp; Diesels have a lot of piston
blowby and once the engine is warmed up, the engine seals tighter and gets
better fuel economy.</p>
<p>In the mk3 Jetta and Passat TDI, the EGR is part of the intake manifold.&nbsp;
EGR metering is a calculated value by the car's computer.&nbsp; In the mk4 and
pumpe duse mk5 cars, the EGR is a separate unit
bolted to the intake manifold and can be replaced as a separate unit if necessary.&nbsp;
These cars also note how much fresh air is coming in from the MAF to determine
how the EGR is working.&nbsp; This is why blocking off the EGR on the TDI can
cause a check engine light/malfunction indicator light.</p>
<p>The introduction of the pumpe duse engine in 2004 also saw the addition of an
O2 sensor in the exhaust.&nbsp; Unlike O2 sensors in gasoline cars, the TDI
sensor is not used to determine the amount of fuel injected.&nbsp; Again, it does
not directly control fuel metering.&nbsp; The TDI O2
sensor is used to calculate the potential for NOx formation and regulate the EGR
valve with more precision, resulting in cleaner emissions.</p>
<p>Here is a picture of a pumpe duse (2004+) diverter valve and EGR cooler.&nbsp; More
pictures can be found in the FAQ articles that show EGR cleaning.&nbsp;<br>

Here is a picture of a non pumpe duse EGR and EGR cooler and the routing (as
viewed from the back of the head) from the exhaust manifold, through the cooler,
and to the intake.&nbsp; More pictures can be found in the <a href="a4/clean-intake-manifold-VW-TDI-carbon.htm">1000q:

removal.</a><br>
<img border="0" src="../images/a4/TB_head_rem/headbacktn.jpg" width="406" height="359"></p>
<p>The 2009+ Jetta, Golf diesel, and Audi A3 TDI have a more complicated EGR system.&nbsp;
The low pressure EGR gasses are filtered before
being sent through the cooler and back into the intake.&nbsp; The high pressure
gasses go straight from the exhaust manifold to the EGR valve and into the
intake.&nbsp; The low pressure is used more at higher engine rpm and load.&nbsp;
It's too
new to know long term reliability but it should be relatively maintenance free
compared to the earlier cars' soot buildup.</p>
<p> Some believe that the EGR and DPF tuning is the cause of occasional engine stuttering
that some people see when at certain partial load
situations like hesitation when cresting over a hill.</p>
<p>Below&nbsp;is the visible part of the 2009-2011 system.&nbsp; The green
highlighted box is the throttle valve.&nbsp; To the right is a cutaway picture
on a demo picture.&nbsp; Its primary purpose is for EGR metering and not engine rpm
metering.&nbsp; Some older engines had problems with the gears stripping (gears
and throttle visible on the cutaway picture, below right) which
caused air delivery problems.&nbsp; The blue box is the EGR valve which
regulates recycled exhaust gasses from the white-wrapped tube (high pressure EGR)
and restricts air during a DPF regen cycle.&nbsp; See <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: DPF
system FAQ</a> for more details on the 2.0L engines.&nbsp; For the 3.0L engines,
see <a href="vw-touareg-tdi-dpf-audi-q7.htm">1000q: DPF system and Adblue fluid
FAQ</a>.&nbsp; At high
engine rpm or load, the visible high pressure EGR valve slowly closes and the
system switches to the low pressure EGR.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/2009-vw-jetta-tdi-egr.jpg" width="534" height="350"><img border="0" src="../images/2010-vw-tdi-intake.jpg" width="399" height="350"></p>
<p>The high pressure EGR gasses are taken before the turbo.&nbsp; The low
pressure EGR gasses are tapped after the DPF, through a filter (shown below), a
cooler (the silver horizontal cylinder), and then recycled back into the intake
path right before the turbo.<br>

<h3><a name="operation">How to check proper operation of the EGR
valve on a VW TDI or Audi TDI</a></h3>
<p>The system is normally controlled by the car computer and a solenoid.&nbsp;
The solenoid controls vacuum to the EGR valve.&nbsp; The mk3 and mk4 early ALH
engine cars use a spring loaded valve that moves up and down.&nbsp; The mk4
later pumpe and mk5 cars use an electronic rotating diverter valve type EGR. &nbsp;This
is less suspect to clogging than a spring type.</p>
<p>To check for the valve proper operation, with the car off, remove the intake
piping before the intake manifold to see the EGR valve.&nbsp; Take a look inside.&nbsp; If you see a lot of
carbon buildup, the intake manifold will need cleaning.&nbsp; A little buildup
of a 2-3 millimeters is normal and does not require cleaning.</p>
<p>For the cars that use a spring loaded valve, remove the vacuum line on the EGR valve and apply suction with a vacuum
pump.&nbsp; Don't try sucking with your mouth since there isn't enough force
and the hose is dirty.&nbsp; The valve should move towards the vacuum diaphragm
when you apply suction.&nbsp; Since it's spring loaded, it should return to
closed when you release suction.&nbsp; If it fails to fully close, it means
there's a problem.</p>
<p>EGR valves that are electrically operated have sensors to show their position
and should trip an error code in the car's computer.&nbsp; It's possible that
the internal gears strip.</p>
<p>If the EGR valve works but the system still doesn't work, check the solenoid,
electrical connectors, and wiring.&nbsp; A vacuum leak can cause malfunction of
the EGR valve.&nbsp; A clogged line can also cause malfunction.&nbsp; If none of
these solve your problem, then the computer (ECU or ECM) or other sensor may be
faulty.</p>
<h3><a name="cleaning">Removing or cleaning the EGR system and intake
manifold on VW TDI or Audi TDI</a></h3>
<p>If there is excessive carbon buildup on the intake manifold and EGR, it must
be removed and cleaned.&nbsp; There is no set time, mileage, or factory
recommendation on when to clean it
since accumulation can vary according to type of engine oil used,
driving style, quality of fuel used (ultra low sulfur diesel, biodiesel, etc.), and even by car.&nbsp;
The reason why VW diesels seem to be more prone to buildup than other cars is
probably due to engine oil mist in the intake system meeting the recirculated
exhaust gases.&nbsp; The oil mist comes from the CCV&nbsp; (Crank Case
Ventilation, similar to a PCV system) system.</p>
<p>The main component of the CCV system is on top of the valve cover and looks
like a black plastic hockey puck with a hose.&nbsp; Diesel cars naturally have more
piston blowby than gasoline engines which pressurizes the engine
crankcase.&nbsp; Since diesels don't have a strong vacuum in the intake system
like gasoline engines, they use a vacuum pump to run the brake booster and other
items.&nbsp; Gas engines are throttled by air - they use a throttle plate which
creates a vacuum and pumping losses as a byproduct.&nbsp; The vacuum pump
creates vacuum on one side and pressure on the other - this air pressure goes
into the crankcase.&nbsp; Air pressure from these two sources must be vented or else it could blow out an oil
seal.&nbsp; The CCV hose is attached to the intake piping before the
turbocharger so that crankcase vapors and air pressure are drawn out of the engine
crankcase.&nbsp; There may be a heating element on the hose to prevent it from
icing up.&nbsp; (The oil in the crankcase vapors is
why it's normal for a little bit of oil in the intercooler to be present.&nbsp;
However, excess oil could indicate a problem.)&nbsp; The soot from the exhaust and oil mist
combine to form the carbon buildup.&nbsp; Again, quality of fuel (biodiesel or
ultra low sulfur diesel), engine oil, EGR system operation, and driving style
all contribute to carbon buildup which must be cleaned.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the introduction of ultra low sulfur diesel in the US, the likelihood
of severe intake manifold buildup has reduced.</p>
<p>To clean the system, it's best to remove the entire
intake manifold and EGR system but you can get away with just cleaning the
intake manifold, EGR cooler, and EGR valve.&nbsp; You MUST remove the
components from the engine when cleaning them.&nbsp; <u>Do not</u> clean them on the
car or use de-carbonizing chemicals to clean the intake manifold.&nbsp; If a
large piece of carbon breaks off and gets stuck in a valve or turbo, it
will result in severe engine damage!&nbsp; The liquid or solids can also go into
a cylinder and cause hydrolock.&nbsp; Dealers used to do &quot;on car cleaning&quot; until they realized that some engines were
damaged from this.&nbsp; If you didn't get the message
- you must remove the parts from
the car to clean them!&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember that the pistons are almost touching
the cylinders in a diesel engine due to the high compression, so even a small amount of standing liquid may cause engine damage.</p>
<p>You can also just replace them with new parts instead of cleaning them.&nbsp;
It is recommended for the mk3 cars to replace the intake manifold because the EGR valve can malfunction and leak oil and
is not removable from the intake manifold.&nbsp; On the
mk4 and mk5 cars, you can reuse the manifold since it's just a cast piece of metal
and the EGR can be replaced as a separate unit as needed.&nbsp; Cleaning
them is a very dirty process so wear clothes that you don't mind getting dirty.</p>

<p>Another problem for the mk3 and mk4 TDI is leaking oil out of the EGR weep hole.&nbsp; The EGR has a diaphragm inside that moves on a shaft.&nbsp; The other
side is vented to the atmosphere.&nbsp; As the shaft wears, it can leak oil that
comes out the weep hole.&nbsp; You don't want to plug the hole or else the EGR
will not function correctly.&nbsp; The mk4 EGR is removable from the intake
manifold.&nbsp; If it weeps oil, replacement is suggested.&nbsp; The mk3 EGR is
not removable from the intake manifold.&nbsp; If it weeps oil, you could replace
the entire intake manifold or reroute the weep hole by running a small hose from
the hole to into the intake tubing upstream of the turbo or onto the ground or a
catchcan.</p>
<p>The EGR on the newest 2009+ TDI is tied into the emission system to a greater
level than earlier cars because of the DPF system.&nbsp; Give a hoot, don't
pollute.</p>
<h3><a name="modify">How do people modify the EGR and why?</a></h3>
<p>People remove the EGR system for two main reasons.&nbsp; Removing
intake restrictions will reduce pumping losses and create more available
power.&nbsp; Removing the EGR will also greatly reduce the amount of buildup
that you will see on the intake manifold.&nbsp; It's important to not seal off
the crankcase ventilation hoses because the crankcase builds pressure
that must be vented!&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people vent the hoses into a catchcan.&nbsp; Do
not vent the hose onto the ground because you'll have an oil slick under the car
and on the road.&nbsp; This is like dumping used oil onto the road - this contaminates the ground/groundwater.</p>
<p>There are a few ways to modify the operation of the EGR system.&nbsp;
The first is to use the adaptation function of a Ross tech VCDS cable to adjust the
degree of EGR system operation.&nbsp; The computer may react to the change in
EGR flow and adjust timing.&nbsp; People report a mileage loss with this method
of adaptation.&nbsp; It is possible to shut it off completely
with a VCDS but this will set a check engine light.&nbsp; It only works on
earlier mk3 and mk4 cars before 2004.</p>
<p>The other way is to physically remove the EGR valve and/or entire system from the
car and replace one end with a block off plate and the other end with a straight
pipe (race pipe).&nbsp; The problem is that
it will set a
check engine light and it removes the anti shudder
valve.&nbsp; The anti shudder valve is the first thing that might stop a diesel engine runaway (a type of
malfunction) and could save your engine from being damaged.&nbsp; See <a href="stop-runaway-diesel-engine-how-to.htm">1000q:&nbsp;
diesel engine runaway FAQ</a> for more details on an engine runaway.</p>
<p>Pumpe duse engines (2004-2008 TDI in North America) use an electronic
throttle plate called an intake manifold flap.&nbsp; This can cause running
problems and possibly cut off air flow to the engine if it's not running
correctly.&nbsp; To remove it you would have to use an aftermarket chip for the
engine to run properly and disable the check
engine light, contact chip tuners for more details.</p>
<p>Here is an example of block off plates for mk4 and mk5 TDI.&nbsp; One plate
has been tapped for an exhaust gas temperature probe (picture by someone named
burpod).&nbsp; You
could also make an EGR restrictor.&nbsp; It's the same idea as a block off plate but
instead of completely blocking the exhaust pipe it has a large hole to just restrict flow.&nbsp; This will reduce how often the check engine light will come
on vs. a block off plate but you'll probably still get it without an aftermarket
chip.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/misc/egrblock.jpg" width="597" height="384"></p>
<h3><a name="stock">Why I do not recommend removing the EGR system</a></h3>
<p>First, it is an emission device.&nbsp; It cost the manufacturer money to
design and put it on your car.&nbsp; They did it for a reason and that reason was
to meet emissions standards.&nbsp; This article is just the facts with the
exception of this single sentence of editorial: I believe in personal rights
more than the strict letter of the law and think a knowledgeable and consenting
adult should be allowed to do anything they want to the things they own.&nbsp;
However, emissions laws are in place because modifying things like car emissions
infringes upon the rights of other people which you don't have the right to do -
that's why there's a law against it.&nbsp; Your rights end where your neighbor's
begin.&nbsp; In countries that have poor emissions controls and poor air
quality, greater emissions strongly contribute to
shorter lives and development of more diseases in people who are regularly exposed to vehicle
exhaust like police and road crews.&nbsp; Since most TDI are daily
drivers, making changes to emissions
devices has a much greater effect vs. special use off road or race cars.&nbsp; Here are some more facts to consider.</p>
<p> If you are thinking of removing
the EGR cooler only so that the intake charge is hotter and in theory, less prone to
carbon buildup, this defeats a large portion of EGR effectiveness since emissions and
temperatures will be higher without the cooler.&nbsp; The EGR cooler also helps warm
up the engine by giving heat from the exhaust to the engine.&nbsp; This results
in a faster warm up, less engine wear, and better fuel economy due to faster
engine warm up.</p>
<p>Removal of the EGR will turn on the check engine light which will results in automatic
failure during emissions testing and can prevent you from registering the
vehicle in many states.&nbsp; Disabling the light or taping over it won't work
since they plug in an obd2 scanner which reads your car's computer.&nbsp; There are ways to trick the computer into
not showing a check engine light like through a chip tune but tampering with emissions devices
is illegal in most places.&nbsp; The newest DPF equipped cars require new
computer programming to bypass the DPF filter or else you'll have raw fuel
dumping into the exhaust.</p>
<p>The biggest gain is reduced cleaning of the intake manifold.&nbsp; However, ultra low sulfur fuel used in all US and
Canadian diesel fuel has greatly reduced major clogging.&nbsp; Biodiesel users report no
excess intake buildup although there'll always be a small film.&nbsp; There are only
small mileage or power gains from disabling the EGR system
since it only operates at partial throttle and idle.&nbsp; Generally speaking,
at full throttle, the EGR
system is closed by the computer so it makes no noticeable difference in peak power.&nbsp;
If you are removing the EGR for reduced pumping losses and the small power or economy gains, bigger and better gains can be
made elsewhere.&nbsp; See <a href="TDI-power-mods-chip-tune.htm">1000q: basic performance
upgrades</a> for a list of starting performance modifications.&nbsp; Also, the pumpe duse cars use an O2 sensor to regulate the EGR system much
more efficiently than non pumpe duse cars.&nbsp; Even newer technologies on the common rail system cars allow
more precise fuel delivery and burn, resulting in less intake
clogging.</p>
<p>I have seen comments that suggest the
ingestion of the sooty EGR exhaust gasses combined with diesel piston blowby can cause oil contamination.&nbsp; This is
false since the soot gets burned in the combustion chamber.&nbsp; Diesel engine oil is
also formulated
to hold soot from any blow by and you would have sooty oil whether you have an
EGR system or not.&nbsp; Engine oil quality and engine maintenance is a much greater factor in proper lubrication
than the presence of an EGR system.</p>
<p>One final thing to consider when modifying the EGR system: if you
modify or delete the EGR system, you will almost certainly have problems getting
warranty coverage on the engine if the dealer notices it.&nbsp; Even though it should not damage the
engine, VW will probably claim that you caused the damage.&nbsp; If you wanted
to pursue it, you would
have to hire attorneys to take any further action and it's not economical
to do so.&nbsp;
It would be hard to deny a claim on the suspension if you modified the engine,
but be prepared to encounter resistance if you make any claim on a modified engine.&nbsp;
If your car is under warranty, I do not suggest making an EGR change unless you
are prepared to change it back when you go to the dealer.&nbsp; Modifications
like an ecu chip or larger nozzles are not easily detected and most dealership
mechanics would never find them but a missing or blocked EGR can easily
seen.</p>
<h4><a name="future">The future of the EGR system.</a></h4>
<p>The EGR system is an emissions device and because it makes such a drastic
difference in emissions, it is unlikely that it will go away soon in diesel
cars.&nbsp; While some gasoline cars have eliminated the EGR, they can also run
tighter air/fuel ratios, something that would never be possible with a diesel
engine.&nbsp; This is partly because a diesel isn't throttled the same way a
gasoline engine is and because they run very lean/efficient (much more air than
fuel).&nbsp; The clogging
problem that older cars have doesn't seem occur on newer cars
as much for a number of reasons: ultra low sulfur diesel fuel, more precise fuel
delivery and burn, better oil separators in the CCV, and new EGR systems all reduce the likelihood of
clogging.&nbsp; Some diesel trucks use a mini catalyst before the EGR to catch and
burn up any soot, preventing most of it from entering the intake.&nbsp; Some
gasoline cars no longer use EGR systems but because of stricter emissions
standards and because of diesel engine needs, this does not appear to be
possible for diesel cars anytime soon.&nbsp; Future gasoline engines are also
raising their compression and approaching diesel-like efficiency levels to be
like half diesel half gas engines.</p>
<p>Some people criticized catalytic converters for killing the 1970's
muscle car but the truth is that poor engineering and high fuel prices killed the
muscle car.&nbsp; And today, cars are far, far more powerful, efficient,
and cleaner then ever. </p>
