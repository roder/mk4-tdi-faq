    <h1>Engine oil for VW TDI (pre pumpe duse cars only)</h1>
<p>First, what model year VW TDI do you have?&nbsp; This page is for earlier 1996-2003
TDI engines, see <a href="engineoilpump.htm">1000q: pumpe duse engine oil</a> if
you have a 2004 or newer TDI sold in North America.</p>
<p>Why should you go to the trouble of making sure the diesel engine gets
the proper oil?&nbsp; Turbo engines require clean oil to lubricate
their many moving parts under high temperature.&nbsp; Diesel engine oil has to
sustain more soot than gasoline engines.&nbsp; Since your TDI has both, it is
especially important to use the proper oils.&nbsp; Not using the correct spec
engine oil could void
the engine warranty.&nbsp; Pumpe duse (PD) engine oils will also work on earlier pre pumpe duse
engines but not vice versa.&nbsp; PD oil isn't necessarily better for an engine
which doesn't require it, it's just that using PD oil in a pre-PD is approved by VW.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>With 2003 and earlier engines, you have a greater choice of oils.&nbsp;
Again, pumpe
duse oils are backwards compatible with older direct injection VW engines but
not the reverse.&nbsp;&nbsp;
VW 505.00, API CI-4, API CH-4, or API CG-4 all can be used in the pre 2004
engines without pumpe duse in addition to pumpe duse approved oils.&nbsp; Some
of the oils listed below are synthetic, some are not.&nbsp; I
recommend synthetic to take advantage of the full change interval.&nbsp;
Depending on the oil, you could even extend the service interval for up to 15,000
or 20,000+ miles but I would just use 10,000 miles oil changes as recommended by
VW.&nbsp; Trucking companies and other industrial engines use
oil analysis to determine when an oil change is needed because it's more economical
in that case.&nbsp; Since passenger cars
and trucks operate on different duty cycles and it's not economical to do
regular oil analysis on your car, it's best to just change it every 10,000 miles.&nbsp;
Changing your oil every 3,000 miles does
nothing but waste of money and oil and modern gasoline cars also have
recommended oil changes of 5-10,000 miles depending on use and oil type.&nbsp; Although
synthetic is more expensive, the longer change interval cuts the number of oil
changes in half, realizing a cost savings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is normal for the oil to be black, even when new.&nbsp; This is normal for a VW TDI and
perfectly fine.&nbsp; There is a little bit of oil remaining in the engine when you do an oil change
and it's enough to turn all of the oil black.</p>
<p>I do not suggest engine oil additives.&nbsp; The
engineers who designed the oil put everything all the additives the engine needs into the
oil.</p>

<p>Listed below are synthetic oils that
meet VW certifications in <b>bold</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
 Oils that are listed in <font color="#FF0000"> red</font> indicate oils that are suitable
for year round use and can be used for the full interval oil changes.&nbsp;
Please note that they don't necessarily overlap and that other oils may be
appropriate.&nbsp; This list is just a recommendation, responsibility for
choosing the correct oil is up to you!&nbsp; <a href="engine_oil_reference_list.htm">Click
