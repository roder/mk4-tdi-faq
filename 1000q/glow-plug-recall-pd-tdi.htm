<h1>Glow plug recall related cold start problems on VW TDI pumpe duse
engines</h1>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article discusses the glow plug recall for 2004-2006 Volkswagen TDI and
how it causes cold start problems.</h2>
<p>Final update as of December 2010 - VW extended the warranty on the glow plug
system only for cars that had the glow plug recall done.&nbsp; See the bottom
for details.</p>
<p>This does not apply to TDI model year
2003 and earlier.&nbsp; Some information and the videos by jsrmonster aka rocketchip.com

<p>In mid 2009, VW issued recall &quot;emissions service action 28E6 R8&quot; to change out the original ceramic glow plugs
on cars with pumpe duse engines with steel glow plugs for all pumpe duse engines
with Bosch glow plugs.&nbsp; NGK plugs were not included in the
recall.&nbsp; Models with pumpe duse engines were the Jetta, Golf, New Beetle,
Passat, and Touareg TDI.&nbsp; The dealer also had to do a computer flash to change glow plug
voltage from 7V to 5V for the new glow plugs.&nbsp; The computer program
controls glow plug voltage by pulsing voltage to the glow plug relay.</p>
<p>The problem is that once
winter came around, many people who had the recall done found that their cars
had a hard cold start or wouldn't start at all!&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, VW
suspended the recall and began working on another computer flash.&nbsp; In July 2010, they started to
test revised programming.&nbsp; In Nov 2010
they sent out letters extending the glow plug system warranty on the cars only to
those which had the recall done.</p>
<p>A diesel engine ignites fuel through compression.&nbsp; Glow plugs are used
to create a hot spot in the engine cylinder which help ignite the fuel on cold
conditions.&nbsp; They also run for a little while after start for faster engine
warm up.&nbsp; This reduces emissions and makes for smoother running.&nbsp; Glow plugs which aren't working well can cause poor starting.&nbsp; The glow
plugs on these engines are located at an angle in the cylinder head.&nbsp; Below is a
picture with the wiring and covers removed for illustration.&nbsp; Related links

<h3>Reason for the TDI glow plug recall</h3>
<p>You can read the <a href="../images/pdf/ceramicglowplug.pdf">original TSB
from VW here</a> and <a href="../images/pdf/pd-glowplug-recall.pdf">another TSB
related to the recall here</a></p>
<p>Older engines used steel glow plugs but VW switched to ceramic starting with
the 2004 TDI engines.&nbsp; This may have been to reduce the wait for the glow
plugs because they
light up faster and/or for emissions.&nbsp; Cold engines (both diesel and
gasoline) create much more emissions than warmed up engines.&nbsp; The reason they were recalled is because the tip can
break off or carbon can build up around the tip, breaking it off during
removal.&nbsp; If the tip breaks off and the engine is running (or cranked while
stopped), it can cause major damage to the engine and turbo.&nbsp; You cannot
just replace ceramic glow plugs with steel plugs because the voltage is
different and it will cause damage to the glow plugs.&nbsp; Therefore, changing
the glow plug type also requires a computer flash.</p>
<p>Below is a picture
showing some of the differences.&nbsp; ALH is the 4 cylinder TDI engine in model
years 1998-2003.&nbsp; BEW is the engine
in 4th generation VW TDI model yearss 2004-2006.&nbsp; BRM is the engine used in the
5th generation 2005.5-2006
Jetta TDI.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/misc/gprecall1.jpg" width="600" height="450"></p>
<p>The old ceramic BHW glow plugs were marked Bosch 0 250 302 0 02.&nbsp; 7v for
7 volt.&nbsp; VW # was n 105 916 01.<br>
The recalled-recall BHW 5v glow plugs were marked Bosch 0 250 402 004 5v.&nbsp;
VW# n 105 916 07.<br>
Other glow plugs should be marked 5v or 7v.

<p><b><font size="4">Dealing with it if you haven't had it done</font></b></p>
<p>If you didn't have the recall done or live in a warm area you aren't affected
by cold start problems.&nbsp; In this
case, if you have cold start problems it's from worn out glow plugs, bad glow
plug wiring, or something else.&nbsp; If the car never had the recall done the
original fragile design glow plugs are still in there and should be replaced
with the more robust design.</p>
<p>If you had the recall done but not the final corrective flash program and live in an area which sees close to freezing
temperatures, you'll notice rough starting when it's cold.&nbsp; Some people had
gotten loaner
cars from the dealer while others haven't.&nbsp; If you can't get a loaner car, using an engine coolant block heater will help
keep the car warm and make it easier to start.</p>
<p>If you have a &quot;performance chip&quot;, any later flash by the dealer will
overwrite the old flash.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing cold start problems and don't want to spend the money
on an aftermarket chip, try the following steps:<br>
-call VW and complain.<br>
-use powerservice diesel fuel additive (white bottle) - it'll help with cold
starts in general and raise fuel cetane<br>
-when the glow plug light goes out, turn the key to start.&nbsp; Do not wait for
the glow plugs to cool off because they are not lit after the light goes
out.&nbsp; They will light once the engine is started.&nbsp; Immediately after
the light goes out, you can also turn the key to off, then immediately back to
on for 2-3 cycles to try to keep the glow plugs lit as long as possible and not
cool off.&nbsp; The heat from the tiny glow plug dissipates into the heavy metal
engine after it stops glowing.&nbsp; Make sure you don't have a weak battery
since this won't help cranking either.<br>
-install an electric engine block heater or park in a warm(er) garage<br>
-remove the rubber elbow before the intake manifold and heat the intake manifold
and cylinder head with a hairdryer before every cold start.<br>
-sue the responsible parties.&nbsp; In my opinion, every TDI that had the
recall done and has cold start problems due to the glow plug system, probably
developed starting problems because of the recall.&nbsp; If your starting problems cause
loss of use of your vehicle, you may be due compensatory damages or at least a
loaner car.&nbsp; Cold
starts are also effected which could cause failure of emissions testing or an
unacceptable level of cold start emissions due to stalling and flooded
engines.&nbsp; However, I'm not an expert and this website page or anecdotal
accounts on anonymous web forums don't count as evidence.&nbsp; Bringing
successful lawsuits are expensive so consult an attorney for legal
advice.&nbsp; If this seems reasonable, feel free to <a href="../forum/index.php">post
your opinion in the myturbodiesel.com forums.</a> </p>

<h3> July 2010 update </h3>

<p>VW started to fix the botched recall in July 2010.&nbsp; For the BEW engine,
it may involve 4 new glow plugs, 4
new injectors, 1 new control unit, 8 bolts, and 4 screws.&nbsp; The bolts and
screws are for the injector holding bracket.&nbsp; Attached below is a receipt
showing the repair.<br>

<p>It appears they changed the part number for the fuel injectors since the
parts catalog still shows a different part number.&nbsp; Other engines may
involve different part numbers. </p>

<h3>Final update on the TDI glow plug recall hard starting as of Nov 2010 </h3>
<p>VW sent me this letter which extends the warranty as mentioned in the
letter.&nbsp; It only applies to cars which had the recall done.&nbsp; The
dealer solution is to install new glow plugs and reflash the computer.&nbsp; You
cannot just install the glow plugs without the reflash. </p>
<p>The car doesn't start as well as it originally did but it's still 5-6 times
better than the botched recall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The invoice references TSB
2024842.&nbsp; The part number for the new NGK glow plugs is VW# n 105 916 09
(n10591609).&nbsp; The difference between the original Bosch glow plugs and the
NGK glow plugs is that the NGK have a steel sheath halfway down and a rounded
tip instead of the narrow tip on the Bosch plugs.&nbsp; Here is an example of a
used on from a mk5 Jetta. </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/misc/jetta-glow-plug.jpg" width="800" height="102"> </p>
<p>Here is the new glow plug.&nbsp; This is why the NGK weren't included in the
original recall - the mk5 Jetta already had this type of sheathed glow plug.<br>
