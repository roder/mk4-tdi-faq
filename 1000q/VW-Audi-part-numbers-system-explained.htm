<h1>How to decode OEM VW part number
and Audi part numbers</h1>
<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article explains the Audi or Volkswagen part numbering system.&nbsp; This does not include how to decode VIN numbers or equipment on your car because
that's a different thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> Part numbers can be found through ETKA (ekta is
something else),
the electronic parts number catalog for Volkswagen Auto Group (VAG).&nbsp; Only
dealers have the official legal copy of ETKA.&nbsp; You can purchase access to an online ETKA
from its publishers but there are free older ETKA online catalogs out there as
well to find the part numbers you want.&nbsp; In addition to VW, VAG includes Audi,
Skoda, SEAT, and Lamborghini because they share many components.&nbsp;
Understanding VAG part numbers will quickly let you cross reference parts across
models.</p>
<p>For example, the part number &quot;058 133 843&quot; is for an air filter that fits 04-05
VW Passat 2.0 TDI.&nbsp; However, it also fits 98-05 Passat 1.8T, 96-02 Audi A4
1.8T, 96-01 Audi A4 V6, and a variety of other V6 and V8 Passat and Audi Allroad,
S4, and S6.&nbsp; This gives some insight into the myth of high performance air
filters.&nbsp; If the 138 hp TDI engine uses the same air filter as the V6 twin
turbo Audi S4 and V8 Audi S6, I'll bet it can flow enough air for the TDI engine
to accommodate any performance modifications.&nbsp; See <a href="TDI-power-mods-chip-tune.htm">1000q:
basic performance upgrades - chip tuning</a> for the basic steps in increasing power of a TDI.</p>
<p>Many dealers don't give out part numbers because if you're asking for them
they know you might try to find the part cheaper online.&nbsp; Some parts
departments will give frequent customer discounts or be cheaper on large bulky
items so there are reasons to shop at the dealer vs. online other than
convenience.&nbsp; However, I've also found markup of 2-300% on a few small
parts at the local dealer vs. an online dealer.&nbsp; When ordering parts online that may have not been original to
your car (like when retrofitting OEM parts or modifying parts) from a dealer, be
careful when giving them your VIN number because it could be rejected as not
equipped on your car.&nbsp; If this happens, you may get the part equipped on your car instead of
the retrofit part you ordered.&nbsp; This is done to prevent ordering
mistakes.&nbsp; To prevent this, make sure the order has a note that you are
modifying something.&nbsp; This shouldn't apply to OEM parts ordered through an independent,
non dealership seller.</p>
<p>Except for hardware like bolts, all modern VW and Audi parts have a part
number printed or stamped somewhere on them.&nbsp; They're not always visible
unless you flip the part over and if they're printed, they can be rubbed
off.&nbsp; Here's an example of the part number for the OEM coolant block heater
on an Audi A3 TDI.&nbsp; Because it's on the handle the number could be rubbed
off through use.<br>

<p><b>Generic OEM suppliers<br>
</b>You may also see other part numbers on the part that don't look like VW
numbers.&nbsp; These are from the suppliers who build the component.&nbsp; For
example, VW doesn't build radios, filters, or timing belts.&nbsp; These are
purchased from companies like Blaupunkt, Bosch, or Mann.&nbsp; In those cases
you can buy the exact same part for less, retail, than the OEM VW part because
it didn't come in a VW box.&nbsp; VW and Audi part numbers will always look like
the groupings found on this page.</p>
<h3>Understanding Audi and VW part numbers</h3>
<p>The modern Volkswagen Auto Group (VAG) part numbering system is organized
into 5 possible sets of letters and numbers.&nbsp; Part numbers are normally in
sets of 3: 058 133 843 (the air filter mentioned earlier) but sometimes they
come in sets of up to 5 like this: 3d0 601 025 p 8z8.&nbsp; The 5 set is just
3 set with 2 optional codes so I'll use that as an example.&nbsp; It's a
19&quot; alloy wheel model &quot;<a href="wheels/19-20-vw-audi-wheels-5x112.htm">omanyt</a>&quot;
off a VW Phaeton.&nbsp; I try to type the part number letters in lower case so that
it's harder to confuse 0 and O, 8 from B, and so forth.&nbsp; One exception is
L: the lower case l and 1 are too similar.</p>
<p><b># <font color="#0000FF">3d0</font> <font color="#800000">601</font> <font color="#008000">025</font>
<font color="#808080">p</font> <font color="#FF0000">8z8</font></b></p>
<p><font color="#0000FF">Set1 <b> 3d0</b></font><br>
The first two digits are the specific model (chassis code) the part goes on.&nbsp; Sometimes it's for a
specific engine or transmission and sometimes these parts are shared across
models.&nbsp; The chassis code can be found in the 7th and 8th digit of the car
VIN.&nbsp; In this example <font color="#0000FF">3d</font> means it's from a VW
Phaeton.&nbsp; The chassis codes can be found at the bottom of the page (they
take up too much space here.&nbsp; The third digit shows if the part is different on left hand drive cars (LHD)
or right hand drive cars (RHD).&nbsp; If it's 0 there's no difference.&nbsp; If
it's 1 it's for LHD and if it's 2 it's for RHD.&nbsp; In this example wheels can
go on both sides so it's 0.</p>
<p><font color="#800000">Set2 <b> 601</b></font><br>
The fourth digit is the main group.&nbsp; This corresponds to what ETKA section
and illustration you can find the part in.&nbsp; In this example it's a wheel so
the main group is 6: Wheels, Brakes (shown below in the ETKA screenshot).&nbsp;
(Dealer accessory wheels are considered extras so they're found in main group
0.)&nbsp; The main groups are:<br>
1 – engine, clutch (ie, turbo, timing belt, air/fuel filters)<br>
2 – gastank and pipelines, exhaust system, heater<br>
3 – transmission<br>
4 – front axle, differential, steering (ie., front suspension)<br>
5 – rear axle<br>
6 – wheels, brakes<br>
7 – hand and footlevers, safety covers (ie., pedals and shifter)<br>
8 – body<br>
9 – electrical systems (ie., v-belt, starter, ignition, instrument cluster)<br>
0 – extras (ie., optional parts, radio, and optional wheels)</p>
<p>The fifth and sixth digit are the subgroup.&nbsp; At the top of the
screenshot you can see &quot;SG&quot; for subgroup 01.&nbsp; In this example,
main group 6's subgroup 01 is wheels.&nbsp; This is also shown in the column of labeled
&quot;MG, SG, Ill-NO.&quot; on the right.&nbsp; There are too many to list but
as another example, main group 6's subgroup 15 is disc brake.&nbsp; 98 is always repair kits.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/etka.png" width="937" height="489"></p>
<p><font color="#008000">Set3 <b> 025</b></font><br>
Digits seven, eight, and nine are random numbers.</p>
<p><font color="#808080">Set4 <b> p</b></font><br>
This is a version or revision code.&nbsp; In this example it's
&quot;p&quot;.&nbsp; If it's included it's usually one or two letters.&nbsp; Sometimes a revised part comes out
or it's slightly different on models with different engines.&nbsp; A newer
version doesn't mean the old version isn't the newest one that will work on your
car.&nbsp; They will use
a, b, c., etc., but also skip letters.&nbsp; Sometimes they name them aa, ab,
ac, etc.&nbsp; Usually the newer part has a later letter.&nbsp; If it's
&quot;x&quot; it means the part is rebuilt.</p>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Set5 <b> 8z8</b></font><br>
This is a color code.&nbsp; In this example the wheel is 8z8 or &quot;brilliant
silver&quot;.&nbsp; If it's included it can be a mix of letters or
numbers.&nbsp; This is often found on interior trim and seats since there are so
many color combinations.&nbsp; &quot;gru&quot; always means means primered or ready to
paint.
