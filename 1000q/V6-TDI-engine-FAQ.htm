<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2><img border="0" src="../images/cata-tdi-engine.jpg" align="right" width="424" height="430">The VW Touareg
TDI and Audi Q7 TDI use the same 3.0L TDI engine, model name &quot;CATA&quot;.&nbsp;
It's a V6, common rail injection single turbo diesel
engine.&nbsp; Here are some FAQ and technical details on the V6 TDI engine.</h2>
<p> If there is a 2011 or 2012 Audi A4 TDI confirmed for the US or Canada,
this engine is the obvious choice since it's already set up for the body and
Audi quattro (VW 4motion).&nbsp; No other engine offers this combination of power and excellent
fuel economy for mid size-large vehicles.&nbsp; In the VW Touareg or Audi Q7 TDI
SUV it gives more
torque than the Touareg's gas V8 (at a much lower engine RPM) with the economy of a V6
midsize sedan.</p>
<p>Since it's a modern common rail diesel, it's quiet running, easy to start,
and smoke free.&nbsp; The emissions treatment system makes it emissions legal in
all 50 states.&nbsp; The Touareg or Audi Q7 qualified for a $1150 federal
income tax credit which is now expired.&nbsp; See <a href="TDI-tax-credit.htm">1000q: tax
credit and TDI</a> for details.&nbsp; Power in the Touareg and Q7 are rated at 225 hp and
406 lb-ft of
torque at only 1,750 rpm.&nbsp; EPA rating in the Touareg is 17 city/25 highway,
significantly more than the V6 or V8 gas engine Touareg.</p>
<p>Some of the technology on the CATA 3.0L TDI engine is common rail fuel
injection which uses extremely rapid piezoelectric (like the vibrating sonicare
toothbrush head) injections of fuel at about 29,000 psi!&nbsp; To compare, the average
gasoline engine injects fuel at about 60 psi.&nbsp; The turbo is a VNT
variable nozzle turbo.&nbsp; Please see <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q:
TDI turbocharging FAQ</a> for more videos, descriptions of VNT, and general turbo
information.&nbsp; The big difference is that it appears the VNT actuator on the
CATA engine is driven by an electric motor instead of a spring/vacuum.&nbsp; The new common rail TDI also use 4
valves/cylinder.</p>
<p>Some differences with the smaller TDI engines are an emphasis on
performance.&nbsp; The 3.0L V6 engine has 50% more displacement than the 2.0L engines in
the smaller VW and Audi TDI.&nbsp; For larger or heavier cars, it could be the
perfect engine because it combines performance and fuel economy.&nbsp; The CATA engine weighs about 490 lbs and compression
is 17:1.&nbsp; The V angle is 90<sup>o</sup> and the crank pins are 30<sup>o</sup>
offset for even firing.&nbsp; It also uses twin intercooling to cool the larger air
requirements vs. the single intercooler on smaller engines.&nbsp; The smaller
engines do get much better fuel economy but they're also mounted in much smaller
and lighter cars.&nbsp; Each cylinder head has its own common rail.</p>
<p>The 8 speed transmission equipped with this engine for 2011 and later models is designed
to handle up to 627 lb-ft of torque so it should be responsive to power upgrades
like a chip or tune.</p>
<p>The basic layout of the engine is a longitudinal with a single turbo between
the rear of the cylinder head V.&nbsp; Here's a video showing how the engine is
built.&nbsp; The laser honing process leaves a smoother and harder surface on
the vermicular cast iron surface than traditional honing.&nbsp; They spin the
engine instead of the laser because it's probably easier to spin the engine than
the laser.<br>

<h3>The new engine for 2010</h3>
<p>European Audi Q7 for 2010 get a completely new engine for 2010.&nbsp; This
engine is only in European Audi Q7 and to the best of my knowledge, hasn't come
to North America yet.&nbsp; (Thanks for the tip, TDV6)!&nbsp; The engine is 55
lighter (down to 425 lbs) and uses 2 instead of 4 timing chains.&nbsp; Using vermicular graphite cast iron crankcase let
them cut 17 lbs from the crankcase and cylinder walls, traditionally one of the
strongest components in a diesel engine.&nbsp; 6 lbs was cut from the cylinder
heads and 4 lbs from the crankshaft.&nbsp; They also changed some hardware and
water cooling lines from steel to aluminum.</p>
<p>The engine itself was plate honed, meaning they used a tension plate to
ensure that the mechanical honing was straight.&nbsp; The UV laser honing
smoothes and hardens the cylinder walls for lower friction as well.&nbsp; These
two measures reduced tangential forces by 35%, according to an Audi press
release.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/photo-honing.jpg" width="751" height="332"><br>
Some innovative features on this engine are the new design of intake manifold
flaps which increase air swirl during low engine speeds and the turbo shaft
bearings were changed to lower friction.&nbsp; The crankcase and cylinder head
also have their own cooling circuits which bypass the crankcase and oil cooler
for fastest possible engine warm up and even shuts off during low load to
increases fuel economy and reduce emissions.</p>
<p>All engines come with start/stop but this feature has never been equipped on
North American engines despite being on their European equivalents.</p>
<h3>What is clean diesel?</h3>
<p>Diesels are cleaner because of the combination of cleaner fuel and
newer technology.&nbsp; The emissions treatments were not usable in North
America due to lower quality diesel fuel until the switch to ultra low sulfur diesel (ULSD).&nbsp; While the law requires this by Dec 2010, all refineries
switched over a while time ago.&nbsp; This is why some retail fuel stations still
don't have the USLD sticker on the pump.&nbsp; The current emissions systems
would fail if the were used with the older low sulfur diesel fuel.&nbsp;
They still sell low sulfur fuel in Mexico so be careful if you travel south of
the border (or south-south of the border if you're from Canada).</p>
<p>Emissions are treated in an oxidation catalyst (catalytic converter), then a
particulate filter (DPF), then a DeNOx catalyst with Adblue fluid.&nbsp; The Adblue fluid
lasts up to 10,000 miles in the VW Touareg TDI and up to 10-15,000 miles in
the Audi Q7 TDI.&nbsp; The Touareg has a 4.5 gallon (16.9L) tank and the Audi Q7
has a 6 gallon (23 liter) Adblue tank.&nbsp; The Touareg
adblue reservoir is under the spare tire.&nbsp; In the Audi Q7, the filler cap is
located next to the fuel filler cap and can't be removed by hand to help avoid
misfueling and the 2 tanks are somewhere under the car.&nbsp; You can use the lug
bolt wrench to loosen the cap.</p>
<p>1500 miles before the Adblue runs dry, the car will give a warning.&nbsp; If you
continue to ignore the warnings and run it dry, the car will not start!&nbsp; This is because without
the urea injection, the car will not meet emissions.&nbsp; While the engine
won't shut down by itself, it won't restart after you shut it off.&nbsp; Below left is a .pdf&nbsp; from Audi describing some aspects of the Adblue system on
their Q7 TDI.&nbsp; Click the thumbnail to view the .pdf file.&nbsp; See <a href="vw-touareg-tdi-dpf-audi-q7.htm"> 1000q: DPF

<h3>Timing chain replacement on CATA V6 TDI engine</h3>
<p><img border="0" src="../images/audia48k/TDIengine.jpg" align="right" width="550" height="413">The timing chain drives the camshafts, oil pump, and balance shaft.&nbsp; The
first chain connects the crankshaft to the intake camshafts on each head.&nbsp;
The second and third chains connect the intake camshafts to the exhaust
camshafts.&nbsp; The fourth chain connects the crankshaft to the oil pump and
balance shaft.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see some of the components in this cutaway illustration.</p>
<p>This basic 3.0L TDI engine has been used in Europe for a while but North
America has never had any 3.0L VW or Audi TDI engine (the 3.0L CATA engine is
specific to North America) so one
can only guess about long term reliability.&nbsp; VW/Audi aren't known for reliable timing chains
but my complaint isn't about chain lifetime or reliability because it's not
known at this time.&nbsp; My complaint is that if
it does need replacement, it will be extremely expensive to replace.</p>
<p>The newer TDI engine on European Audi Q7 for 2010 switched over to a simpler
2 chain system.&nbsp; Since it's a completely different engine, it's not
possible to swap your chain drive.</p>
<p>
Some older gasoline V6, V8 Audi
and VR6 VW engines used a similar chain system and needed chain service as low as
100,000 miles.&nbsp; This is very low for the average timing chain.&nbsp; There is no specified replacement interval for the chain
because it's considered a lifetime component.&nbsp; The problem is that 150,000
miles is generally considered a normal lifetime for a car and part of the economics of
buying a TDI is that the engine should easily last 200,000 miles and beyond with
normal maintenance.&nbsp; There are many TDI owners who have gotten 300-400,000
miles on original engines and normal maintenance.&nbsp; While the rest of the
engine should last a long time, if the timing chain does need service, it would
be considered major
maintenance.</p>
<p> Servicing the CATA 3.0L TDI engine's timing chain
requires removing a number of components to pull the engine/transmission out of
the car and tear down the back of the engine.&nbsp; I estimate that labor, parts, and tax will
cost up to $7000 vs. $1000 to replace a timing belt (even at the dealer)!&nbsp; Timing belts
are designed to be easily serviceable and are not considered lifetime
components.&nbsp; Belts normally work like new until they suddenly fail so
replacement is considered normal maintenance.</p>
<p>As a rough estimate, the labor to replace the chain is over 30 hours.&nbsp; Assuming
average dealership rates and sales tax, it will be about $4000 in labor.&nbsp; As an rough estimate, the parts cost of
the core parts (not
including the sprockets, bolts, gaskets, fluids, hardware, etc.), is over $1000.&nbsp;
Below is a list of just the chains and tensioners.&nbsp; If you include sprocket replacement and the other misc parts, the
total parts cost is about $1900.&nbsp; And that is internet wholesale
pricing-&nbsp; with
tax and dealer markup, I'm sure parts will be at least $2400.</p>

<p>The V10 TDI engine sold in the US spec Touareg TDI V10 used timing gears which have longer life
and lower noise compared to a chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;It probably would have been
quieter and more reliable to have a gear drive vs. a chain but the CATA engine
isn't designed for it.&nbsp; Most V engines
with overhead cams don't use gears because it's too long of a distance from the
crankshaft to the camshaft.&nbsp; This longer distance is probably why a chain or belt is
used on the CATA TDI engine.</p>
<p>Compared to hybrids, Toyota defines a Prius battery lifespan as 180,000 miles
and US states with CA emissions warranty it for 10 years.&nbsp; The difference is
that Toyota has a good reputation for reliable hybrid batteries and battery
prices are going down.&nbsp; Audi and VW's reputation with chains isn't as good and
labor prices to pull an engine out to replace a chain aren't going down anytime
soon.&nbsp; In any case, if your car needs a new chain and you like the car I'd hold onto it because it's still cheaper than buying another
similar car.&nbsp; Hopefully VW's chain is more reliable on this engine due to a
longer history in Europe.&nbsp; </p>
