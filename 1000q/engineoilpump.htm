<h1>Approved engine oils for pumpe duse VW and
Audi TDI engines
(2004-2006 VW TDI)
</h1>
<p>First, what model year Audi or VW TDI do you have?&nbsp; This page is for pumpe duse
(PD) engines up to model year 2008.&nbsp; See <a href="engineoilNP.htm">1000q:
pre pumpe duse engine oil</a> if
you have a 2003 or earlier TDI sold in North America.</p>
<p>North American VW TDI, model years
2004-2005 for the VW Passat TDI, V10 VW Touareg TDI&nbsp; and 2004-2006 Jetta/Golf/New Beetle
TDI are pumpe duse and require pumpe
duse specification oil.&nbsp; If you can't figure out if your car is PD, use a
PD engine oil because higher spec.
oils are compatible with engines calling for a lower spec. but lower
spec is not compatible with engines that require higher spec. oil.&nbsp; If you
need help more identifying your car, take a look at <a href="mk4%20cos_diff.htm">1000
answered questions: mk4 cosmetic differences</a> to see cosmetic differences of the
mk4 cars.&nbsp; Also see <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">1000
answered questions: direct injection vs pumpe duse</a> to see mechanical
differences that pumpe duse cars had and for an explanation of common rail vs.
pumpe duse vs. direct injection.</p>
<p>NOTE - The VW Touareg TDI V10 got a DPF filter in 2006.&nbsp; (This exception
also applies if you have a non North American car with the optional DPF).&nbsp;
Because of the DPF filter, use the newer 507 oil.&nbsp; See <a href="DPF-Adblue-FAQ-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
DPF regeneration and Adblue fluid FAQ</a> for more details.&nbsp; All other
2009+ TDI should use the newer 507 engine oil.</p>
<p>Why should you go to the trouble of making sure the diesel engine gets the
correct engine oil?&nbsp; Turbo engines require clean oil to lubricate their many moving
parts under high temperature.&nbsp; Diesel engine oil has to sustain more soot
than gasoline engines.&nbsp; Since your TDI has both, it is especially important
to use the correct engine oil.&nbsp; Not using the correct oil could result in a refusal of
warranty claim on the engine.&nbsp; Pumpe duse engine oils will also work on earlier pre pumpe duse
engines but not vice versa.&nbsp; If you have an earlier pre pumpe duse car,
using newer pumpe duse oil is not better.&nbsp; Linked
here is a TSB regarding pumpe duse engine oil: <a href="../images/pdf/pumpeoil.pdf">engine
oil TSB</a>&nbsp; These oils are
generally more expensive but are the VW spec oil for your pumpe duse engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I did not write <u>best</u> oil because what engine oil is best is
debatable.&nbsp; Some pumpe duse engines have had excess
camshaft wear even when using the correct VW engine oil.&nbsp; See <a href="multi/camshaft-inspection-replace-vw-tdi.htm">1000q:
camshaft inspection and replacement</a> to check for wear or replace worn lobes
or bearings.&nbsp; Suspected causes are:
incorrect engine oil (even when serviced at the VW dealership), dirty engine
oil, soft camshaft lobes (defective construction), narrow lobes vs. older
engines (bad design), high pressures on the camshaft lobes (needed in pumpe duse
engines), unknown causes, or a combination of all or some of these - see the above camshaft
inspection article for more details.</p>

<p>In any case, the only engine oil which will qualify for engine warranty
coverage is the oil that is approved by VW.&nbsp; Some camshafts have experienced excess wear even with pumpe duse engine oil.&nbsp; Ultimately
it's up to you to determine what brand/weight/spec engine oil you want to
use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some have suggested zinc additives like ZDDP to cushion the
camshaft lobes but excess zinc can damage catalytic converters.</p>

<p>Pumpe duse engine oil must meet VW oil standards: 505.01, 506.01, or 507.00.&nbsp; Here is another TSB which lists engine oils approved by VW - right click, save as
or click to view.&nbsp; Scroll down to see the 501.01, 506.01, or 507.00 oils.<br>

<p> The recommended oil change interval is before every 10,000 miles.&nbsp;
Trucking companies and other industrial engines sometimes use engine oil for
15,000-30,000 miles but they use oil analysis to determine when an oil change is
needed because it's more economical for them.&nbsp; Passenger cars operate on
different duty cycles and it's not economical to do regular oil analysis on your
car so it's best to just change it every 10,000 miles.&nbsp; Changing your oil
every 3,000 miles does nothing but waste of money and oil and modern gasoline
cars also have recommended oil changes of 5-10,000 miles depending on use and
oil type.&nbsp; Although synthetic is more expensive, the longer change interval
cuts the number of oil changes in half, realizing a cost savings.</p>
<p>It is normal for the oil to be black, even when new.&nbsp; This is normal for
a VW TDI and perfectly fine.&nbsp; There is a little bit of oil remaining in the
engine when you do an oil change and it's enough to turn all of the oil
black.&nbsp; To see how to do an oil change, refer to the how to lists linked in
the blue button at the top.</p>
