<h1>mk4 vs. mk5 VW TDI differences</h1>
<p>
The mk5 cars are the 5th generation VW cars and were released with diesel engines
in the jetta only.&nbsp; The early
(2005.5-2006) jetta are <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm"> pumpe duse</a>.&nbsp; In
late 2008, VW released the <a href="a5/2009-2010-VW-Jetta-TDI-checklist.htm">new
2009 jetta sedan and jetta
sportwagen</a> with common rail direct injection in an all new 2.0L TDI
engine.&nbsp; The major differences to past engines is the dual camshafts,
intake on the front of the engine, turbo pointing up from the exhaust manifold, <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">
common rail fuel injection</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Body/safety</b></p>
<p>
Door panel skins are removable for repair, see <a href="a5/door-skin-jetta-remove.htm">1000q:
door skin removal</a> for tips.</p>
<p>
All TDI come in the US with ESP stability control, ABS, front, side, and head curtain
airbags.</p>
<p><b>Comfort</b></p>
<p>The mk5 jetta is slightly larger than the mk4 jetta.</p>
<p>The front and rear seats are not interchangeable with the mk4 vs mk5 without
custom modification.</p>
<p>In dash 6 CD changer is standard with the premium 7 radio.&nbsp; <a href="a5/09_10_TDIdifferences.htm">Later
cars used the touchscreen premium 8 radio</a>.</p>
<p><b>Suspension</b></p>
<p>The MK4 cars have torsion beam rear axles.&nbsp; The MK5 cars have a
fully independent rear suspension.</p>
<p><b>Engine/drivetrain</b></p>
<p>The <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm"> DSG</a> transmission is an option on MK5 cars, it was only available in some
MK4 cars like the last years of the New beetle.</p>
<p>MK5 engine code is BRM, mk4 pumpe duse engines use the BEW in the jetta, new
beetle, or golf. The engines (except passat) are basically the same but the MK5 engine is rated for slightly more
hp/tq due to some minor modifications.&nbsp; The BHW in the passat is a very
different engine. </p>

<p>These modifications include a front mount intercooler in front of the
radiator in the mk5 cars, the MK4 uses
a side mount intercooler.&nbsp; The mk5 cars also have a better air
intake.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>All MK5 diesels use an O2 sensor in the exhaust, only pumpe duse MK4 cars use
an O2 sensor.&nbsp; No pre-pumpe duse MK4 cars use an O2 sensor in the exhaust.&nbsp;
It is not for fuel metering but for controlling the EGR and emissions.&nbsp;
Newer 2009 TDI use a regenerating diesel particulate filter, backpressure valve,
and sensors in the exhaust to control the high and low pressure EGR and post
combustion injection .</p>

<p>MK5 is electronic assist steering, all other cars use a hydraulic assist
steering.</p>

<p>Although the headlight switches look the same, the electronics are totally
different and are not compatible.&nbsp; The actual switch is also thicker on the
mk5.</p>

<p>The n75 solenoids are not interchangeable:&nbsp; BEW is 1K0 906 627 A,&nbsp;
ALH is 1J0 906 627 A</p>

<p>The starter that was used from 1996-2005 in the VW TDI is different from the 2005+ starter.</p>
<p>The water pump is a completely new design.&nbsp; The BRM engine from the mk4 Jetta uses
the VW# 045 121 011H water pump.&nbsp; The mk4 BEW engine uses the VW#&nbsp; 038 121 011G or J water pump</p>
