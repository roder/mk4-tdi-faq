How to stop a runaway diesel engine - with focus on VW and Audi TDI</h1>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>All diesel engines are &quot;throttled&quot; by controlling the amount of
fuel they consume.&nbsp; If a diesel engine starts to eat its own engine oil,
you could have a diesel engine runaway.&nbsp; This article shows why a TDI
engine runaway happens and how to stop it.</h2>
<p> A runaway is
when engine RPM suddenly surges and races by itself as if the driver had stomped on the throttle or
accelerator pedal.&nbsp; If the car is in gear, the car will also accelerate
which could create an emergency situation.&nbsp; Burning engine oil will also create a smoke
screen out the
exhaust or around the engine.&nbsp; This article shows some causes of unintended
acceleration from a runaway diesel engine and suggests some corrective actions
for North American VW and Audi TDI 1996-present.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this or any other unintended or unexplained acceleration occurs, <u>the
driver's first priorities are to concentrate
on safe operation of the vehicle, keep it under control through braking and
steering input, and to regain control over engine power or shut the engine off
as soon as is safe and practical.</u>&nbsp; Pull the car over to the side of the
road only as soon as it's safe to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's
not worth getting into an accident to try and save the engine only to lose your
life and maybe someone else's.&nbsp; Any information on this page is just a
generic suggestion not specific to your exact situation because it's not
possible to foresee every cause or response to a potentially dangerous
situation.&nbsp; The full
responsibility of decision making and the reaction to a runaway engine is on the
driver and is specific to each situation.&nbsp; See the TOS for the full legal
disclaimer.&nbsp; As with any other preparedness drill, you will have
the best results and least panic if the response is first practiced under safe,
controlled conditions.&nbsp; While many of the ideas on this page apply to all
diesel engines, the possible solutions and mechanical details are only for
Volkswagen and Audi TDI.&nbsp; Other diesel cars may have different systems and
therefore, different possible causes and solutions.&nbsp; Reacting in an unsafe manner or letting the engine
runaway and the car accelerate without control could cause a dangerous situation.&nbsp; Lastly, a lot more TDI engines are ruined by
faulty or neglected timing belt changes than runaway engines so I wouldn't sell
my TDI or not buy a diesel because of this rare but possible condition.</p>
<h3><img border="0" src="../images/TDIdrivebywire.jpg" align="right" alt="drive by wire pedal" width="270" height="416">Basic technical background</h3>
Diesel fuel is basically an oil and engine oil will burn
      through compression in a diesel engine like regular diesel fuel.&nbsp;
      Most diesel engines can even run off of propane, vegetable oil,
      coal dust, or even ambient gasses in the air (like if a backhoe breaks
      open a natural gas line).&nbsp; Older pre-TDI diesel VW engines had a common
problem with blowby oils entering the intake path and causing a runaway but TDI engines are set up
differently so their runaways are normally due to bad turbos.&nbsp; Gasoline engines or pre-TDI could
      also experience a runaway from the throttle cable sticking, the gas pedal sticking,
      or something falling into the throttle mechanism linkage or jamming it internally,
      any of which could hold the throttle open.
      <p>All VW and Audi TDI use Electronic Power Control, or drive by wire
      &quot;throttle&quot;.&nbsp; The major component in drive by wire is the accelerator
      pedal - it uses an electrical sensor to detect pedal position.&nbsp; An
      example of a TDI accelerator pedal and sensor is shown to the right.&nbsp; There are only electrical wires coming out of
      the sensor to tell the car's computer how to control engine fueling - there is no mechanical cable
to move an air throttle. Since the first TDI in 1996 (North America), all TDI
      computers are programmed so that fueling is cut down to idle after about a half second
      if the brakes are applied even if you're still stepping on the accelerator pedal.&nbsp; If
      the accelerator pedal signal is lost, the car's computer will limit engine
      RPM to a high idle or about 1200 RPM.&nbsp; This will let you drive slowly to the nearest
      repair.
<p>
While unintended acceleration could have many causes, the most
likely cause of a runaway engine in modern VW and Audi TDI diesel engines is
from leaking turbo oil seals and bearings.&nbsp; Below left is a video about runaway diesels - it's for domestic diesels but
it explains the basics of a diesel runaway engine.&nbsp; Below right is a BMW diesel in the
middle of a runaway.<br>

<h3>The most likely cause of a runaway engine in VW TDI or Audi TDI - the turbo oil seals</h3>
<p>A worn turbo can send engine oil into the air intake
because air must pass through the turbo on the way to the engine.&nbsp; Oil can
leak out of the seals.&nbsp; With proper care and good synthetic oil, the seals can
last the life of the turbo.&nbsp; However, excessive thrust movement and
pressures (caused by manufacturing issues, bad oil, or worn bearings) can cause
excess wear and oil leaks.&nbsp; The compressor and
turbine sides of the turbo can respectively leak oil out the intake or exhaust
sides.&nbsp; Oil that goes out the exhaust side is burned up and causes black or
&quot;blue&quot; smoke.&nbsp; This can shorten the life of the catalytic
converter due to melting or clogging.&nbsp; Oil that goes into the intake is ingested by the engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;For
more information on turbos, please see <a href="turbocharging.htm">1000q:
Turbocharging FAQ</a>.</p>
<p> The line between a leaky turbo and
an engine runaway is when the engine suddenly increases in rpm and draws the
engine oil out of the turbo seals and feeds off that oil, raising the rpm,
drawing even more oil out.&nbsp; Once the runaway gets started, the feedback cycle
increases
until you shut the engine off by cutting fuel or air or all the engine is burned up and the engine
seizes.&nbsp; Again, the reason why you don't hear about this on gasoline
engines is because gasoline engines can't run on engine oil.&nbsp; In a gasoline turbo engine, oil in the fuel effectively reduces the octane of
the fuel and makes the engine more likely to detonate.&nbsp; In a diesel engine,
it can result in a runaway engine.</p>
<p>Note that the crankcase ventilation system does put a light oil mist
into the intake.&nbsp; This settles in the low spots like the intercooler and
bottom of the hoses (like at the turbo outlet hose).&nbsp; It's normal to have a
little oil pooled in the bottom of the
intercooler but too much oil could be from a leaky turbo.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you drive
the car hard and rev the engine to a high rpm, it can blow out a little bit of
this oil and burn it up along with any carbon deposits.&nbsp; This will often
create a small puff of smoke when you accelerate hard.&nbsp; It's possible that
a short burst of acceleration which stops on its own is from a little pooled
engine oil being burned up.&nbsp; The line between a little burst of
acceleration and a runaway engine is how much oil was just consumed and if it
leads to the feedback cycle of higher rpm leading to more oil consumption.</p>
<p>Some less common causes of runaway are overfilling the engine oil by so much
so that oil mist floods back into the intake or worn piston rings creating too
much blowby which sends an oil mist back into the engine.&nbsp; Because of the
modern cyclonic oil separators on modern TDI, oil from blowby mist is more
likely to settle back into the engine.&nbsp; As mentioned before, ambient combustible
gasses could also cause a runaway.&nbsp; If the engine inhales natural gas or
propane, these will be burned in the engine and increase RPM until the gasses
are no longer present or air is shut off (or the engine breaks).</p>
<h3>How to stop a runaway diesel engine</h3>
<p>An engine needs fuel, air, and compression/spark to run.&nbsp; You can't
control compression and a diesel has no spark plugs.&nbsp; Therefore, you must cut off fuel or
air to stop a
runaway diesel engine.&nbsp; When you take
your foot completely off the accelerator pedal it helps cut off the fuel but if the runaway
is strong, the engine is already feeding off the engine oil and won't stop on
its own.</p>
<p>Again, the driver's first priority is to maintain positive control and safe
operation of the vehicle through braking, steering, and power control.&nbsp; Traffic and
conditions permitting, the first reaction to a runaway TDI engine is to
apply braking and turn the ignition
key to &quot;OFF&quot;.&nbsp; As mentioned above, drive by wire will reduce
engine RPM to a high idle if you step on the brake and accelerator pedal at the
same time after about a half second.&nbsp; You are also conditioned to pull the key out of the
ignition slot when you shut the engine off but don't do that (explanations
below).</p>
<p>Do not hit anything with your car in order to stall the engine or stop  unintended
acceleration if it will result in injury or damage to you or others.&nbsp; The engine will continue to
runaway but it's not worth saving the engine if it means possible injury, death,
or damage to you or a 3rd party from intentionally hitting something.&nbsp; No matter the cause of acceleration, shifting the transmission
into neutral (applies to all transmissions like auto, manual, or <a href="DSG-faq-VW-Audi.htm">DSG</a>)
will prevent power from the engine being transmitted through the transmission and immediately
stop any further acceleration from engine power.</p>
<h4>Shutting off the fuel to stop the runaway engine</h4>
<p> In mk3 and mk4 TDI that used the Bosch VE injection
pump (see <a href="pumpedusedesc.htm">1000q: injection pump vs. pumpe duse vs.
common rail</a> for details),
turning the key off will close the fuel shut off solenoid and cut fuel to the
fuel injectors.&nbsp; (The solenoid is basically an electrically controlled
valve).&nbsp; Mk3 TDI don't have anti shudder valves so you know the
fuel cut off solenoid is working or else your engine would never shut
off.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a mk4 with injection pump, you can test the
function of the solenoid by having a helper turn the ignition ON but without starting
the engine.&nbsp; This will give 12V to the solenoid and you will hear a small
click, meaning it opened.&nbsp; Turn the ignition off and you will hear it click
closed (the default position).&nbsp; The location of the solenoid is shown below.&nbsp;
The right picture is a closeup showing the solenoid wire.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/fuelshutoffsolenoid.jpg" alt="TDI fuel shut off solenoid" width="1088" height="457"></p>
<p>In mk4 pumpe duse TDI and newer TDI (model year 2004 and newer in North America), the fuel injectors are controlled by the car's computer.&nbsp; Turning the key to OFF will
stop the
computer from injecting fuel at the fuel injectors which cuts the diesel and
will shut it off if it's not running away on engine oil.</p>
<h4>Shutting off the air</h4>
<p>Turning the key to &quot;OFF&quot; will also close the anti shudder valve or
electronic intake flap &quot;throttle&quot;.&nbsp; This shuts off air to the
engine which should stop the engine even if it's still getting fueling by
burning its engine oil.&nbsp; Mk3 VW TDI did not have these
valves, only mk4
and newer do.&nbsp; If you have a 98-03 mk4 TDI, test the operation of the valve by manually closing
it with the car
idling.&nbsp; The general location and the lever are pictured below (yellow arrows).&nbsp;
The default resting position of the lever/valve is open.&nbsp; The lever and
valve will be hot if the engine is also hot so use a glove or rag to shield your
finger and hand while you close the valve.&nbsp; Move the lever
against the spring pressure and it will close the valve inside.&nbsp; Make sure you close the valve all the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;The engine should shut off.&nbsp; If it doesn't, there is an leak downstream
of the valve, the valve isn't fully closing, or you aren't closing it all the
way.&nbsp; You won't hurt anything by moving the valve manually to choke the
engine.&nbsp; (Disclaimer - don't stick your fingers, loose clothing, hair,
necklace, or anything else near the alternator belt or any other moving belts
while the engine is running because they could get caught and it could result in
severe injury or death.)</p>
<p>The solenoid which controls the vacuum operated anti shudder valve in the
1998-2003 mk4 TDI engines gets 12-14V until the engine shuts off or you press the
clutch pedal.&nbsp; It's partly based off engine RPM.&nbsp; In other words, when
you shut the engine off using the key, the valve closes for only a second
because the engine stops immediately.&nbsp;
This may be because the car computer knows that the engine is shut down or
because the valve is vacuum operated and when the engine stops running there is
no longer a source of vacuum.&nbsp; If you shut off the engine while coasting downhill or during a runaway
engine, this valve will close until the engine shuts off or until you step on the
clutch.&nbsp; This was first tested by someone named &quot;Ski in NC&quot; and
verified by others.&nbsp; The forces acting on the valve should be about equal on both sides
(because it pivots in the
middle) and it doesn't require much force to close but there are cases in which the
vacuum operated anti shudder valve failed to stop a runaway engine.&nbsp; This could be due to
the runaway being too strong, carbon buildup preventing full closure of the
valve (see <a href="a4/clean-intake-manifold-VW-TDI-carbon.htm">1000q: intake
cleaning</a> for ALH engine, articles for other engines can be found in the FAQ)
, a broken vacuum line, or other unknown factors.</p>
<p> 1998-2003 engines use a vacuum operated valve (shown below).&nbsp; 2004 and newer
engines use a more robust electrically operated valve that should be better at
stopping an engine runaway.&nbsp; Because the later ones use an electric valve
you can only test it through a VCDS tool output test.&nbsp; Start the software
and select &quot;Engine&quot;.&nbsp; There is a button for output tests which
will cycle this valve to test it.&nbsp; You cannot close it by hand.&nbsp; It's
possible the gears inside the flap assembly that move the valve get
stripped due to wear but this should throw an error code for the intake
flap valve if it's not working.<br>
<img border="0" src="../images/runawayengine.jpg" alt="TDI anti shudder valve" width="892" height="431"></p>
<h4>Manually choking off air to the engine</h4>
<p>It's possible to manually close the anti shudder valve on 98-2003 mk4 TDI to
starve the engine of air.&nbsp; Again, the tests mentioned earlier show that a normally operating valve stays closed until the engine is
stopped.&nbsp; I would also be
cautious of manually closing this valve during a runaway because if the engine
fails in a manner which cracks it open (not likely but possible), metal bits could be forcefully ejected
from the engine and injure you.&nbsp; If the engine really does blow
open, my total guess is that standing to
the passenger side (for left hand drive cars) of the engine and near the
windshield may shield you better and reduce the chance of
injury vs. standing in front of the engine (in front of the car).&nbsp; This is
because you are somewhat shielded by the fender
and wheel well and you don't have to reach over the engine to manually close the
anti shudder valve.&nbsp; In addition, standing to the side means you are only
facing the #1 cylinder.&nbsp; All 4 cylinders are facing you if you stand in
front of the engine.&nbsp; Some remove the valve to remove the EGR and
restriction in the intake but I would leave the valve in place since every little bit
helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;See <a href="egr-system-clogging-TDI.htm">1000q: EGR FAQ</a> for more info on the EGR system.</p>
<p>While it's possible to starve the engine of oxygen by flooding the air intake
with something like a CO2 fire extinguisher or ripping off the air intake hose
to cram a cloth into it, I personally wouldn't.&nbsp; Light diesel engines rev much
quicker than larger engines and can runaway so fast
that by the time you've recognized the problem, stopped the car, and opened the hood,
the engine is already damaged.&nbsp; The other steps on this page are faster and
safer and should work for other possible causes of runaway.&nbsp; If you decide to carry a CO2 extinguisher in the car, make sure
it's securely mounted in the car to avoid being a crash hazard or getting stuck
under the pedals.&nbsp; A cloth crammed into the air intake will get sucked in
and jam the turbo/slow the airflow.&nbsp; It will damage the turbo but it's
already damaged so no harm done.&nbsp; Don't risk personal injury by grabbing hot hoses, accidentally getting caught by
any exposed running belts on the engine, or be exposed to scattering parts if it
were to fail catastrophically.</p>
<h4>Stalling the engine with a manual transmission</h4>
<p>All manual transmission VW and Audi TDI can also stall out the engine by upshifting into top
gear and applying the brakes.&nbsp; This is a very effective method of stalling the
engine.&nbsp; When you push in the clutch pedal or put it
in neutral during a runaway the engine
has no resistance from having to move the car.&nbsp; Therefore, the engine would
continue to rev higher until it died.&nbsp; If you
upshift or downshift the car may accelerate.&nbsp; An upshift to top gear <u> with</u> firm application of the brakes will stall
the engine because the brakes have much, much greater force than the engine can
make to move the car.&nbsp; Again, don't risk getting into an accident just to
save the engine so only brake when it's safe and practical, conditions
permitting.</p>
<h4>Hazards when shutting the engine off, pulling the key out while moving, or
responding to unintended acceleration</h4>
<p>The first hazard of shutting the engine off is removing the key from the ignition
slot and activating the steering wheel lock.&nbsp; With the car parked and key
off and out,
try turning the steering wheel left or right.&nbsp; You will hear a click past a
certain point and the steering wheel will not return to center.&nbsp; This is the steering wheel lock
activating for parking the car.&nbsp; The steering
wheel lock is why on some cars, you have to turn the steering wheel a little to
release a key stuck in
the ignition switch - the steering wheel lock is on the edge of its mechanism
and is jamming the key.&nbsp; After you turn the key
to the OFF position (if it was previously ON), turning the
wheel shouldn't activate the steering lock - try it to confirm.&nbsp; However,
just
inserting the key in the OFF position will not unlock a locked steering wheel -
you have to turn it ON.</p>
<p>You are conditioned to pull the key out whenever
you turn the car off and physically and mentally practicing this will help unlearn that
habit in the event of an emergency situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the car was in the middle of a turn
and you pulled the key out by habit, this could lock
the steering wheel to the side and result in loss of steering control and a crash.&nbsp;
If you accidentally pull the key out of the ignition slot, make sure the
steering wheel won't lock by putting the key back in the ignition slot and turning it to the ACC position and not ON, RUN, or START.</p>
<p>When the key is off or out, the brake lights will still work as normal.&nbsp;
The headlights may shut off and the turn signals may not work.&nbsp; The hazard
lights (emergency flashers) will.&nbsp; If the car
is having a runaway there will be a big cloud of smoke behind you from the
burning oil so if possible, turn on the emergency flashers.</p>
<p>If a car is following too close or can't see you, maximum
braking could also cause an accident.&nbsp; Again, it's not worth having an accident
to save the engine but the sooner you can brake and stall the engine and halt
any further acceleration or runaway, the better.</p>
<p>You may also see or hear a low engine oil buzzer and warning message or light
on the
instrument cluster.&nbsp; The normal reaction is to shut the engine off but
because it's running away your focus should be on keeping the car under control
and safely stopping it as soon as possible, conditions permitting.</p>
<p>The power assist on the brakes comes from the vacuum operated brake
booster.&nbsp; If engine isn't turning over because you shut it off and the
transmission is in neutral, it doesn't make vacuum for the brake
booster which results in only having power assist of the brakes until
vacuum brake boost is depleted.&nbsp; This is normally about 1-2 pumps of the brakes.&nbsp; If there is no power assist on the brakes, the
brakes will still work but the pedal will be very stiff and require much more
force to actuate the brake calipers to slow the car.&nbsp; Without power assist,
it takes a lot of effort to slow the car at all.&nbsp; All TDI that I can think of get vacuum from a vacuum pump that is on the driver's
side of the camshaft.&nbsp; Anytime the engine is turning over, the vacuum pump
is running.&nbsp; Assuming that
everything is working correctly, vacuum for the brake booster means you have normal power assist on the brakes.&nbsp; An example where the engine is turning
over but not running is if the engine is off and the transmission is in gear
while the car rolls down a
steep hill.&nbsp; The kinetic energy of rolling down the hill is what's turning
over the engine.&nbsp; The engine will only stop
turning over if you take the car out of gear.</p>
<p> To test how the brakes
feel without vacuum boost, with no traffic or people around, find a small hill
that you can roll down safely with (disclaimer) plenty of room to the side and adequate
runoff at the end&nbsp;in case you can't apply the brakes.&nbsp; Testing under
controlled daytime practice conditions and with a driving instructor is the safest way to
test no-power-assist braking feel.&nbsp; In neutral gear, shut off the engine but
don't pull the key out for the reasons mentioned above.&nbsp; Step on the brakes.&nbsp; You'll find that
the first pump and maybe the second pump feels normal.&nbsp; After that the
brake pedal will get much harder to press but it's still possible to stop the
car.&nbsp; You just have to press the pedal really hard and stopping distances
will be much much longer.&nbsp; If you have a manual transmission you can also
test the system in gear with the engine off and the car coasting.&nbsp; As long
as the engine is turning over, it will make vacuum for the brake booster.</p>
<p>On a side note, very few gasoline car engines have a vacuum pump because they get vacuum from the intake manifold.&nbsp;
The pressure difference (vacuum) is present because the throttle is partially
shut on most gasoline cars during normal operation.&nbsp; If a gasoline engine experiences a runaway (like
from a stuck throttle pedal), the throttle is wide open and there is little-no
vacuum present in the intake manifold.&nbsp; This means the brakes will only
have power assist until the vacuum reservoir is depleted.&nbsp;
This could be a contributing factor of why people who experience runaway engines
on the highway say they lost their brakes - if they only halfheartedly pump
the brakes they will lose power assist for later brake applications resulting in
a rock hard brake pedal.&nbsp; Again, the TDI vacuum system is the opposite of
most gas engines because they get vacuum from an engine driven pump - it makes
vacuum whenever the engine is rotating.</p>
<h4>Once the engine is stopped</h4>
<p>Once the engine is off and stopped it won't restart on its own.&nbsp; If the
car still has momentum it should be able to roll forward in neutral gear to the side of the road
- pull over as soon
as is safe and practical.&nbsp; If you've stopped a runaway, don't start the
engine
until the engine has been examined by a diesel specialist.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Many people
experienced an uncontrollable runaway immediately after stopping a minor runaway
because they continued to drive the car.&nbsp; Have
it towed to a diesel specialist and explain that the diesel engine had a runaway.&nbsp;
If the car is not stopped in a safe place, leave the car when possible and it's safe
and wait for help away from any moving cars.&nbsp; The smoke cloud or a stalled
car could distract other drivers and it's not safe to be close to moving cars
since you or the car could be hit.</p>

<h4>The aftermath - don't restart the car!</h4>

<p>If you immediately stopped the engine and the engine oil level didn't go
down it's possible that the engine will run fine after replacing the turbo.&nbsp;
At best, there may have been a little oil pooled in the intercooler that got
sucked into the engine and was consumed by the engine but with no drop in the
oil level.&nbsp; If that case it's really not a runaway because it didn't go
into the feedback cycle amplification of a
runaway.&nbsp; You should do further diagnosis to make sure the turbo isn't
leaking oil into the intake path and that nothing else was damaged.&nbsp; If you have a mk4 car, see <a href="a4/turbo-removal-TDI-engine.htm">1000q:
turbo replacement</a> for more details.</p>

<p> If the engine revved far above
redline, it's possible the valves floated and were smacked around and
damaged.&nbsp; If the engine raced for a while and then stopped on
its own, it's probable that something was damaged.&nbsp; The engine either sucked enough
oil that the engine seized from lack of lubrication or bent something.&nbsp; If
enough oil goes into the engine cylinders, the engine will hydrolock and
probably bend the rods first.&nbsp; Low engine oil and high revs may have also damaged the turbo,
camshaft, or crankshaft bearings.&nbsp; Further diagnosis is needed.&nbsp; Always drain the
intercooler of oil as well.&nbsp; If lots of oil comes out it's very likely that
the turbo oil seal blew.&nbsp; Remember, you can
replace an engine but you can't replace yourself or others so always react to the runaway
with safety for people first, then property.&nbsp; Although a runaway diesel
engine is rare, it does happen so be prepared.</p>

<p>Why doesn't Audi or VW include an emergency procedure in the owner's manual for stopping a runaway
engine (just for TDI)?&nbsp; People would at least be aware of
this potential problem but they really don't include detailed procedures on how
to react to any emergency situation.&nbsp; I don't know if it's for legal
reasons, if it falls within the realm of driver education and training, or
because runaway engines is bad press.&nbsp; It won't help sell cars but all
gasoline cars could catch fire and blow up from the flammable gas
vapors igniting (static electricity) during fueling and I don't think this is common knowledge either.&nbsp;
As a final note, this cause of
runaway engines is possible on any diesel engine and even gasoline engines can
experience uncontrolled acceleration.</p>

acceleration or race on its own?&nbsp; Please ask in the <a href="../forum/index.php">myturbodiesel.com</a>
