<h2>This page shows how to program mk4 (mark 4, mkiv, 4th generation) VW keys or
remotes,
replace the battery, or replacement.&nbsp; Some steps require the SKC due to the
immobilizer.</h2>
<p>This includes the New Beetle, Golf (up to 2006), and Jetta and
Passat (up to 2005).&nbsp; For mk3 (1995-1999) Jetta TDI or Passat
TDI keyless entry programming, see <a href="../a3b4/key-remote-program.htm">1000q: mk3 key FAQ</a>.&nbsp;
For mk5 Jetta (2005.5 and newer) remote programming, see <a href="../a5/key-replacement-mk5-Jetta.htm">1000q: mk5
remote and key programming</a>.</p>
<p>The remote/key is 2 halves but has 3 separate components: the keyless entry remote,
the metal flip key, and the immobilizer chip.&nbsp; Each must be correct to get the
key/remote to work as intended.&nbsp; You must program the immobilizer (totally
separate from programming the keyless entry) or else the
immobilizer will shut off the engine after a second.&nbsp; See <a href="../multi/immobilizer-VW-Audi-FAQ.htm">1000q:
immobilizer FAQ</a> for more details on the anti theft immobilizer. </p>

<p>Misc key info: The key operates at 315
mHz (I guarantee you that the signal <b>cannot</b> be transmitted over a cell
phone).&nbsp; The replacement battery for the remote is CR2032.&nbsp; If you
have the older rubbery style it uses a CR1620.&nbsp; The
immobilizer chip does not need a battery because it's an RFID (radio frequency
identification) chip energized by the
antenna in the ignition key slot.&nbsp; The RFID chip range is about 1&quot;
from the ignition key slot when in a key (through plastic) and about 3&quot;
when bare. </p>

<h3><u>The first step in getting a new or replacement remote/key - MUST READ</u></h3>

 <i>-If the car does not have an immobilizer </i>you can program the keyless entry
    yourself and have a new key cut almost anywhere.&nbsp; This applies to early
    mk4 cars with no immobilizer and earlier VW generation cars.
<p>
 <i>
 -If you have an immobilizer and have an existing broken key</i> (broken
    remote or flip key), you can salvage the parts out of your existing key and
put them into a new key.&nbsp; For example, if the key ring loop is broken,
split the key and replace it with a used part.&nbsp; VW doesn't sell just key
ring loops.&nbsp; You can also swap your current immobilizer chip into the
replacement key instead of bringing it to the dealer.&nbsp; The RFID chip and a
closeup are pictured below (white arrow).&nbsp;Use some acetone or carefully cut around it to remove the chip and then swap it with new key's chip. Then you can program the keyless entry
    yourself and have a new key cut anyplace that can cut the metal side
milled/reverse cut key.&nbsp; You could tape the old chip to
    the outside of the ignition cylinder but that defeats the
    immobilizer anti-theft function.&nbsp; And if you dug it out why not just
put it into the new key?</p>
<p>
  <i>
  -If you have an immobilizer and you don't have an old key</i> to salvage
    the immobilizer chip out of, you must read the notes below about the SKC code and key
variations.</p>

<h4>How to tell if you have an immobilizer and differences by year</h4>

<p>If you have the yellow car symbol pictured a few paragraphs below on the
instrument cluster, you have an immobilizer.&nbsp; The two types of VW immobilizers
used in the mk4 generation in North America are immobilizer 2 and 3.&nbsp;
Generally speaking, VW up to about 1999 do
not have an immobilizer and immo-1 was not equipped on cars sold in the
US/Canada.</p>

If you have Immo2, you need the SKC to use a new key or instrument cluster.&nbsp; It has an
    emergency drive function that will let you drive to the dealership or
    mechanic for them to fix it but you must know the SKC code.<p>If you have Immo3, you need a SKC to use a new key,
swap instrument clusters, or swap ECUs.&nbsp; The
big difference with immo3 is that it you cannot reprogram used immobilizer chips
(used keys).&nbsp; VW doesn't sell just chips.&nbsp; Remember, the door-unlock-remote part is separate from the
ignition key-chip half,&nbsp; A used key fob (after programming) can still unlock the doors as long as the
FCC number is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the Jetta/Golf/New Beetle, immobilizer 2
was introduced during 2000-2001 in the US/Canada.&nbsp; If you have a
2000, it might have immo2, check for the yellow car symbol on the instrument
cluster.&nbsp; If your VW is
model year 2002-2005, it probably has immo-3.&nbsp;&nbsp; To see if you have
immobilizer 2 vs. 3, see the <a href="../multi/immobilizer-VW-Audi-FAQ.htm">1000q: immobilizer FAQ</a> 
.&nbsp; Immo-4 is on 2005.5-2006 and
newer mk5 cars.</p>
<p>Pictured below is the immobilizer symbol on a mk5
car.&nbsp; Your yellow car symbol should look the same.&nbsp; It turns on very
briefly when you turn the ignition on.&nbsp; If you don't see
any immobilizer symbol than you most likely don't have an immobilizer.<br>

<h3>The cheapest way to get a new replacement VW Jetta, Golf, or Beetle key</h3>
<p>The cheapest way to get a new replacement key is to buy a cut NEW key off ebay or an
OEM VW internet parts dealer (usually a dealership who sells parts online) and take it to your local dealer for immobilizer programming.&nbsp; It only
takes a maximum of 30 minutes (it really only takes 5 minutes to set everything up and
about 1 minute per key) but expect 1 hour labor charge (0.5 hour if they're
nice).&nbsp; You
can program up to 4 keys per car.&nbsp; The average internet wholesale price
should be well under $100 shipped
internet wholesale plus dealer programming of the immobilizer vs. $300-350 at the
dealer for everything.</p>

<p> If you don't know your key's part number (split the key
in half using the procedure below to check it) then I suggest going to the
dealer to make sure you have the correct key part number and FCC ID.&nbsp; <u>The
part numbers below are only a guide</u>, double check the correct part number
with your parts vendor because this website is not responsible if you order the
wrong key!&nbsp; There may have been left over parts that were used on your car
so the exact VIN number transition may be off.</p>

<p> When programming any new key to the immobilizer, you MUST have all keys
present because it &quot;resets&quot; the immobilizer chip and the old ones
won't work.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, if the car has immobilizer 2 you can reprogram used
immobilizer chips (and used keys).&nbsp; If your car has immo 3 or above, you
can't.&nbsp; A new
key blade half is required since the immobilizer chip is inside that half.&nbsp;
Again, you could use a used remote half if it's the same FCC ID or as parts.</p>

<h4>Retrieving the Secret Key Code (SKC) number or bypassing the immobilizer</h4>
<p>If you have a car 2000-2001, you might still have the 4 digit plastic tag
with the SKC printed on it under a scratch off panel.&nbsp; Pictured below from <a href="http://mark1vws.com/index.html">mark1vws</a>
is the plastic tag.&nbsp; If you have a car model year 2001 or higher,
or you lost the plastic tag, you don't have the SKC and you cannot program the
immobilizer yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>If you cannot find this then you must
retrieve the SKC yourself to work on the immobilizer or program new key chips!&nbsp;
VW no longer has access to give you the SKCs.</b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; </b></p>

<h3>Mk4 VW key part numbers&nbsp;</h3>
<p> (click to see retail prices, make
sure you read the above paragraph, double check with your vendor if it's only the
remote or the whole key!)&nbsp;&nbsp; The <u> best</u> way to check your key's part number is to take
your key apart and check the printed part number inside.&nbsp; The tips below
are just general guidelines.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vwkeys.jpg" width="455" height="134"><br>
#1- If you have a car with VIN <span class="partdetail-description">&gt;9M 1
    083 594</span> and a build date 11/98-09/00, (about model year
    1998-2001) your remote probably looks like <b>#1</b> pictured above, part
    number should be VW# 1j0 959 753f, this is for immo 2.&nbsp; The key buttons
    are more flexible and are oval.&nbsp; It has no hard keychain loop and
use 2x CR1620 batteries instead of the ones shown in the picture at the top of
the page.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
#2- If you have a car with build date 10/00-05/01 (about model year 2001,
    maybe some 2000), you may have the remote that looks like <b>#2</b>, it
    should be VW# 1j0 959 753t and is for immo 2.&nbsp; The key buttons are
    plastic and are more squared.&nbsp; It has a hard keychain loop.&nbsp; This part number should
    work with any mk4 VW pre immo and up to immo 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
#3- If you have a car built after 05/01 (about model year 2001-2002 and
    above), you
    should have immo 3 and use remote #2, it is either VW# 1j0 959 753 am, this
    has been superceded by 1j0 959 753 dc,
    it should have immo 3.&nbsp; It has a hard keychain loop.&nbsp; The key buttons are more
    plastic and are
    more squared.&nbsp; You don't have immo 4 unless you have an mk5
    car.&nbsp; Passat used immo2 later than the Jetta/Golf.</p>

<h3><span class="posttext">Keyless entry programming</span></h3>
<p>Remember, this
only programs the keyless entry, it has nothing to do with the immobilizer, you
still have to find someone who can program the immobilizer or take it to the
dealer for programming.</p>
<p><span class="posttext"><b>To program your keyless entry:</b></span></p>

<span class="posttext">-Put your good key in the
ignition and turn to &quot;ON&quot;, do not start the engine.&nbsp; Make sure
all the remotes you want to use are present because they have to be programmed
at the same time. <br>
-Close the
door and insert key #2 into the driver's side lock.&nbsp; Lock the door. <br>
-Within 5 seconds of locking the door, press unlock 2 times on the new remote,
key #2.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -(if this is remote #3, press unlock 3 times.&nbsp; if this
is remote #4, press unlock 4 times).<br>
-If there's a chirp or beep do not press it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the car has recognized the new keyless
entry remote.<br>
-Repeat with other remote or unlock the car and turn
    off - done.</span>


<p>

<span class="posttext">If you only have 1 key you have to use a <a href="http://ross-tech.com/" target="_blank">ross
tech VCDS cable</a> to do this or have the dealer do it.&nbsp;</span>

<h3><span class="posttext">Battery replacement or key disassembly</span></h3>
<p><span class="posttext">To replace the battery, keychain, or switchblade, you
have to take the key apart.&nbsp; If you want to replace a broken keychain, just
buy the cheapest remote you can find on ebay and swap the battery housings.</span> Here's a video showing battery replacement.</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/7ZZ-ZEcGnKc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>Here's a video showing key disassembly. Ignore the later part which deals with model year 2009 and newer keys. See the pictures below as well.
  <br>
  <iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/0RZrQbZQ8yM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p><span class="posttext">To separate the key and remote section, just grab each
  half and pull hard.&nbsp; There's also a small notch on the side where you can insert a pry.<br>
</span><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vwkey1.JPG" width="540" height="207"></p>
<p>Use a thin pry at the yellow dotted lines to split the keyless entry half in
two.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vwkey2.JPG" width="598" height="242"></p>
<p>Here's the other side.&nbsp; Ignore the screw and disc, that's for replacing
the switchblade.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vwkey3.JPG" width="630" height="358"></p>
<p>Once the remote half is apart, put in a new CR 2032 battery.&nbsp; The negative side (in this
pic the side without writing) should face you when you put the battery in.&nbsp;
If your keychain is broken, you can just replace that half with a cheap key from
ebay.&nbsp; If you have the older round button-rubbery fob it uses a CR1620
battery.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vwkeydis.jpg" width="709" height="461"></p>
<p>To replace the switchblade or remove the immobilizer chip, see the earlier
picture
with the screw.&nbsp; Use an exacto knife to pry off the VW badge and remove the
screw.&nbsp; The switchblade will come apart.&nbsp; I suggest driving the knife
where the screw is because there's a little space for it to go under the badge.&nbsp;
Otherwise it'll dig into the plastic.</p>
<p>The switchblade and button sit on top of a torsion, or twisted spring.&nbsp;
This is what makes the switchblade open.&nbsp; The spring sits on a tab in
the plastic, note the yellow arrow.&nbsp; Note the tabs when reassembling
and twist the switchblade so that it opens correctly.&nbsp; If the switchblade
is clamped
closed you twisted the spring in the wrong direction.&nbsp; If your switchblade
action is getting tired, twist the spring another turn in the correct direction
to make the key open with more force.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vwkey4.JPG" width="398" height="405"></p>
<p>The rest of assembly is the reverse of removal.</p>
<p>Do you have any tips on reprogramming your VW smart key or would like to know
how to program a key you bought off ebay?&nbsp; Please ask in the <a href="../../forum/index.php">myturbodiesel.com forums</a><p>
