<h4>General glove box FAQ</h4>
<p>
The glove box handle often breaks on the early mk4 cars.&nbsp; Try to be gentle
when opening and closing the glove box because the latch, hinge, and internal mechanism can break.&nbsp; This article saved the original pictures, mirrors the articles, and rearranges a few existing writeups into one readable FAQ article.</p>
<p>I mirrored this content because  the original pictures were lost from another site.&nbsp;
  Combining them with new comments also helps explain some of the procedures.&nbsp;

<h4>Basic glove box function and failure modes</h4>
<p>
The glove box/door can come out as one whole unit (7 torx screws).&nbsp; The
door uses two hinges on the bottom and two slider arms at the top which restrict
how far the door can open.&nbsp; There is a shock which dampens the movement of
the door and is attached to the right hinge on the glove box door.&nbsp; The hinges
and door
handle/latch are the most likely to break.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you force the door open or closed, it stresses the
hinge attached to the shock and breaks the hinge.&nbsp; One possible solution is
to reduce the resistance of shock or just be careful when opening/closing the
door.&nbsp; VW did change the shock stiffness in later years and later changed
the entire glovebox design, you can modify yours instead of buying a new one.&nbsp; The glove box
door latch also tends falls off it's hinge.&nbsp; Inside the door are a latch
mechanism, these can also fall off their hinges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>The totally new glove box design</h3>
<p>
Around 2002-2003, VW changed the glove box, this FAQ applies to the
earlier style glove boxes.&nbsp; The later style glove boxes are much less
likely to break due to their design and are also larger.&nbsp; It's possible to swap the
early style glove box for the new style, all you have
to do is remove a metal scissored piece inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of the differences between the
early and newer
glove boxes:</p>
<p>Early glove boxes:<br>
- smaller inside because of extra impact absorbing members surrounding the passenger
airbag<br>
- use spade lightbulb 5W<br>
- separate switch part which clips on and fails easily due to flimsy plastic<br>
- separate hinge pins which fail easily<br>
- separate piston to dampen the door - too stiff and contributes to hinge
breakage<br>
- metallic frame riveted to back of glove box presumably to help spread out impact loads.<br>
<br>
The glove box has been totally redesigned in more recent cars like the R32<br>
- 20% more interior volume because no impact absorbing members around the passenger airbag<br>
- uses mini 3W/5W festoon style bulb instead of spade style<br>
- switch for lightbulb is integrated into the lightbulb fixture via a spring mechanism. The spring is the actual circuit
breaker<br>
- integrated hinge parts<br>
- instead of a piston, there is a gear which dampens the door</p>

<h3><a name="Total">Glove box removal&nbsp;</a>
</h3>

<p>Note - it's possible to repair the hinge without removing the glove box
assembly so read all the writeups to decide what you want to do.
</p>

<p>First remove the entire glove box assembly.&nbsp; The original author removed the center
bracket, armrest, and shifter console to get access to a 7th hidden torx screw
on the passenger side.&nbsp; This is not necessary, just remove the 6
visible screws and move the glove box a little to access the 7th screw.&nbsp; If
you want to remove the center bracket or shifter console, see <a href="center-console-remove.htm">1000q:
center console removal</a>.&nbsp; Carefully open the glove box and pry off the side dash panel.&nbsp; The side
dash panel pops off.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove1.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove2.jpg" width="320" height="240">&nbsp;
</p>

<p>Here is the glove box assembly and a backside view.&nbsp; There are two metal pieces that run down each side of the
glove box.&nbsp; There are two hinge pins on the lower left and right side. These pins go into the metal pieces on the
back and is the pivot for the glove box door.&nbsp;
On the left side there is a shock which controls the motion of the door.
<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox2.jpg" width="536" height="338">&nbsp;<b><font size="4"><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox3.jpg" width="567" height="390">
</font></b>
</p>

<p>
 Remove the shock (T20 Torx screw). You will need to move the plastic
piston of the shock to access the screw.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox5.jpg" width="576" height="432">
<br>
<br>
Flip up the plastic shock mount and push the
piston into the base of the shock.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox6.jpg" width="576" height="432">
</p>

<p>
 Remove the 2 black hinge pins that are on the left and right sides of the
glove box.&nbsp; Pry the pins out using a screwdriver.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox7.jpg" width="576" height="432"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox8.jpg" width="576" height="432">
</p>

<p> Gently push down on the upper hooked
plastic slider and you should be able to open the door farther.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox10.jpg" width="576" height="432">&nbsp;
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox12.jpg" width="576" height="432">
</p>

<p>
The lower hinges and the upper sliders should be free, lift the glove box door up and out.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox13.jpg" width="576" height="432"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox14.jpg" width="576" height="432">
<br>
You can now replace your old glove box
door with a new one, repair the hinges, or modify the shock as shown
below.&nbsp; Remember, if you replace the glove box door you will also need to
change the glove box lock.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="handle">Glove box latch fell off, internal
mechanism broke, or lock cylinder replacement</a>
</h3>

<p>There are two things on the handle that can break.&nbsp; The glove box's
latch pins can break or the internal opening latch can break.&nbsp; If you
replace the door you also have to change the lock cylinder.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><b>Hinge repair</b>
</p>

<p> There are
2 small metal pivot pins which hold the glove box latch.&nbsp; If you want
to remove the latch, lift the latch and pick at the pins and it should come out.&nbsp; They
can also fall out on their own, here is a tip to push it back.&nbsp; The problem is that the
factory pins are too short to push in when the handle is in place.&nbsp; The
original author used 1/8" steel rod stock (from home depot) to increase the
diameter and length of the latch pins.&nbsp; The original pins are metric and smaller
in diameter so
drill out the holes in the handle to 1/8" to take the new pins.&nbsp; You don't need to drill the pin seats in the glove box door,
the 1/8" stock can be pushed in with a bit of force (twisting them helps). A tight fit here is really good anyway, since the metric pins
tend to fall out by themselves due to looseness.
</p>

<p>
In this pic you can see the old pins in the middle and the new pins to the left.&nbsp;
Push the original pin into hole and mark the depth with some tape. Then place
some wire insulation over the drill so that the new holes will only be drilled as deep as the old
holes.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gloved4.jpg" width="680" height="406">
</p>

<p>
Here is a picture of the new pins.&nbsp; The new pins are now long enough to push in from the hole between the handle and the glove box door.&nbsp;
Insert the pins from the center and push the pins outward to the positions shown.&nbsp;
This picture almost shows the pin end in the slot.&nbsp; You can use a pen knife blade to engage the
pins because they only go in a few mm.&nbsp; It also helps to move the handle
back and forth slightly while pushing in the pins.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gloved5.jpg" width="640" height="480"><br>
<br>
Test fit.
<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gloved6.jpg" width="640" height="480">
</p>

<p>If the problem is internal, it's possible that one of the internal levers
broke.&nbsp; Pry the door skin apart using a blunt pry tool.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gloved1.jpg" width="640" height="363">
</p>

<p> Once it's
open, you can see the white levers and their pivot pins.&nbsp; In the
below example, one of the white plastic levers came off due to a broken
pivot.&nbsp; A short stubby screw was used to repair.&nbsp; While you're in
there, secure the other side too.<br>

<p><b>Lock cylinder replacement (skip if you are not using a new glove box
latch)</b>
</p>

<p>If you bought a new glove box door you need to transfer the old lock to the
new lock or else the new door won't lock.&nbsp; You could swap your old latch to
the glove box door but this is just as easy.&nbsp; There are 4 tabs that hold the
lock cylinder.&nbsp; Using some thin pliers, gently bend the tabs back.&nbsp;
Be careful because the tabs can break easily.&nbsp; If you are putting the lock
cylinder on a new door, try to avoid breaking the tabs so you can have a spare
latch, if you don't want to keep the old latch then break away!<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox16.jpg" width="576" height="432"> 
</p>

<p>Bend the upper plastic piece at the top of the handle back and you should be
able to push out the cylinder out the front using a screwdriver.&nbsp; Make sure to insert your key
before pushing it out or else the tumblers can fall out.&nbsp; If they do, see <a href="glv_box_lockrepair.htm">1000q:
glove box lock cylinder reassembly</a>.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox18.jpg" width="576" height="432">
 <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox26.jpg" width="576" height="432">
</p>

<p>Transplant your old lock to the new door latch.&nbsp; Keep the key in the
lock and hold the key in the vertical position (the unlocked position).&nbsp;
Also make sure that the tab in the back of the lock is on the left side when
putting it back.&nbsp; Use your hand to support the door and gently guide the lock back into the glove box handle with the key inserted.&nbsp;
The lock should pop in without too much effort.&nbsp; Test the lock with your key to insure that
it functions.<br>

 <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox28.jpg" width="480" height="360">
</p>

<p>If you are reusing the door latch, push it in and hope that it snaps into
place or use the procedures shown above.&nbsp;

<p><b><font size="4"><a name="hinge">How to fix a broken glove box door hinge
without removing the entire glove box and and
modify the shock&nbsp;</a></font></b></p>
<p>Instead of removing the entire assembly or buying a new door, you can try
repairing the glove box on the car.</p>
<p>Carefully open the glove box and pry off the side dash panel.&nbsp; The side
dash panel pops off.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove1.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove2.jpg" width="320" height="240">&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this case, the right side hinge broke.&nbsp; This is the side that is
stressed by the shock.&nbsp; Remove the hinge pin by prying it out.&nbsp; The
glove box door rotates on this pin and
may be tricky to access.&nbsp; Below are some pictures of the glove box totally
removed for a better view of the hinge pins.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove3.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove4.jpg" width="320" height="240">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox7.jpg" width="576" height="432"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/gbox8.jpg" width="576" height="432">
</p>
<p>Refer to the picture of the rear of the glove box assembly above.&nbsp; You
can see the shock on the left side of the picture.&nbsp; The 7th screw is slightly hidden on the passenger side and you have to wiggle
the door to get access to it.&nbsp; Below you can see the shock and it's mount.&nbsp;
Remove it.<br>
&nbsp;
 <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove5.jpg" width="320" height="240">  </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove4-1.jpg" width="320" height="240">
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove6.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p> Your goal is to remove the shock along with the broken hinge out of the glove box.
The shock twists in the shock mount as you open and close the glove box door.&nbsp;
Using a T20 torx bit, disassemble the shock mount from the broken hinge piece.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove7.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove8.jpg" width="320" height="240">&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the hinge connector from the top of the shock<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove9.jpg" width="320" height="240"></p>
<p> You now want to modify the shock to have less resistance.&nbsp; Pry off the white plastic cap
on the shock. Be careful because the internals are spring loaded.&nbsp; Inside is a piston in a closed cylinder with a return spring.&nbsp;
Cut out some of the coil springs to reduce it's resistance.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove10.jpg" width="320" height="240">
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove11.jpg" width="320" height="240">
</p>
<p> 
Drill a small hole at the back of the shock body and put a few drops of lubricating oil inside the shock body.&nbsp;
This will also reduce the resistance of the shock.&nbsp; Do not use regular grease because grease stiffens when cold.&nbsp; Drilling a
hole will also let the air exit faster when the glove box door is forced open or
closed, preventing too much tension on the hinges.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove12.jpg" width="320" height="240">
</p>
<p> 
Reassemble the shock.&nbsp; It still provides some cushioning for the glove box
door but should move much easier.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To fix the broken hinge pieces, use superglue.&nbsp; 5 minute JB weld won't work
well because small movements will prevent it from setting correctly.&nbsp; You
can use superglue for an initial hold and then use JB weld to reinforce the
broken area.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove13.jpg" width="320" height="240"> 
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/glove14.jpg" width="320" height="240"> <br>
<br>
You can put the hinge pin and shock back.&nbsp; The hinge pins may need to be
tapped in with a hammer and screwdriver.&nbsp; Close the glove box and test it's
motion.&nbsp; You will see how the shock-to-hinge pin mount will line up with the front of the shock.
The easiest way to test the motion is to slide the pin that connects the shock with the hinge mount.

<h3><a name="swap">How to swap your early style glove box with
a later style glove box</a>
</h3>
<p>The later style glove box is better than the early style because there are
no latch pins to break or stiff hydraulic piston.&nbsp; It is also larger.&nbsp;
The only modification is that you have to remove the accordion like bracket and
it's bracket underneath the dashboard, pictured below (2 parts).&nbsp; The
glove boxes have completely different ways that the light works, but the older style will clip right in and the light will work
fine.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/swap2.jpg" width="512" height="248">

<p>
Below left is the early style glove box, next to it is the new style glove box.<br>
