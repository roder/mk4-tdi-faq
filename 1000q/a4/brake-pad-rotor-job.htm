<h2>
  Introduction -
  This article shows how to replace the front and then the rear
  brakes.</h2>

<p>
  You may want to flush the hydraulic system while you are under there.&nbsp; It
  should be done every 2 years regardless of mileage or as needed.&nbsp; For
that procedure, see: <a href="brake-clutch-fluid-change.htm">1000q:
bleeding brake/clutch hydraulic system</a>.&nbsp; Performance pads will greatly
  improve brake feel but the best way to improve braking capacity is to step
  harder on the pedal and get better tires.&nbsp; For a FAQ and mythbusting of
brake tips,&nbsp; see <a href="../brake_FAQ.htm">1000q: basic
brake FAQ</a></p>

<p>I prefer Mintex redbox or Axxis deluxe because they are quiet OEM level
brakes that dust less than stock.&nbsp; Performance pads can sometimes squeal
when cold or eat up the rotors.</p>

<p>The rear rotors on VW tend to wear out faster than the front brakes.&nbsp; This is
due to light braking with the electronically distributed braking on your TDI.&nbsp;
If you are doing the fronts, check the rears as well.&nbsp; Also check to make
sure the rotors are still thick enough to last until the next brake job or
replace them.&nbsp; In
general, the rotors should be turned and cleaned if there is sufficient material
to remove and stay above the minimum thickness.&nbsp; Also check for warping or
runout.&nbsp; However, since &quot;turning the rotors&quot; involves putting
them on a brake lathe and removing the top layer of material to make it flat, it makes them more likely to warp.&nbsp; Braking
generates heat and the less rotor mass there is to absorb
the heat, the more likely the
rotor is to warp.&nbsp; It should only take
a few minutes to turn the rotors at a shop, but you could buy new rotors
just as easily.&nbsp; If you are having problems with rotor warping, buy better
rotors or check hub runout.</p>

<p>If you have a TDI/2.0L engine and wish to upgrade to bigger brakes and
calipers you have to change a few things.&nbsp; If you have a 1.8T or VR6, you
have removable brake carriers and can more easily upgrade to bigger
brakes.&nbsp; See <a href="BB-upgrade-kit-mk4-VW.htm">1000q: mk4 big brake
upgrade</a> for details.</p>

<h3>
  Procedure to replace the Front brakes
</h3>

<p>Chock the rear wheels, apply the parking brake, and put the car in gear if
it's a manual transmission.&nbsp; Jack up the end of the car you want to work on
(using the factory jack points) so that the tire is just barely touching the
ground.&nbsp; Remove the center cap to get to the lug bolts, and loosen but don't remove
the bolts.&nbsp; I do this so that the car's full weight isn't resting on the
wheel.&nbsp; This makes it easier to loosen the lug bolts.&nbsp; Do not completely
loosen the lug bolts until the car is secure on jack stands.&nbsp;
See <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
tips for the mechanic</a> for more useful tips on jacking up the car and other
topics.&nbsp; See <a href="jackpoints.htm">1000q: jack points</a> to
see the jack points on my 2003 Jetta.&nbsp; If you can't get the lug bolts loose
try using a breaker bar or your leg to increase leverage and because your legs are stronger than your arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> Make sure the car is secure before
removing the lug bolts or wheel and going any further and see the legal
disclaimer for the full TOS.</p>

<p>Remove the brake pad wear sensor wire (attached to the brake pad) if
equipped.&nbsp; There is no brake wear sensor in the rear.</p>

<p>Pry the
dust cap off&nbsp; the dust boot, marked by the dashed red line (below).&nbsp; The rest of the rubber boot should not be
removed.&nbsp; Remove the guide pin bolt inside (marked with green below, it's
inside the caliper) with a 7mm allen
wrench.&nbsp; Repeat for upper and lower bolts.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/brake1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Here is a picture of the back of the brake caliper showing both black caps
and a brake pad wear sensor plug at the top.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/brakeb.jpg" width="480" height="640"></p>

<p>Pry out the pads and slide the caliper to the side.&nbsp; If your rotors are
worn down a rusty lip has formed on the outer diameter of the rotor and will
cause the pads to catch a little, just wiggle the pads out.</p>

<p>Don't let the caliper hang by the
brake line - tie it to something with a piece of string or rest it on the removed
wheel.&nbsp; Hanging it by the brake line can cause the line to weaken.</p>

<p>Clean the seals and slides with with brake cleaner.</p>

<p>The new pads will not fit onto the rotor since the new pads are thicker than
the old ones and the caliper piston have moved out for the old pads.&nbsp; Open the brake fluid reservoir to let some pressure out.&nbsp; I do not
suggest opening the bleeder since it's dirty and an air bubble might get into the
brake fluid circuit, depending on how the caliper is positioned.&nbsp; Bleeder nipples (marked with yellow in the above picture)
are always on the top of the caliper to let air out and prevent air from
getting in but I prefer to not open it.</p>

<p>To move the caliper piston, use a c-clamp or brake caliper tool to press the piston back into place.&nbsp; Below is
a picture of an Autozone brake caliper tool to press the piston back.&nbsp;
Autozone or Advance loan this tool and many others for free or you could buy one at any
auto parts store.&nbsp; Note - the rear brakes are slightly different and
require a special tool like the one pictured below to press the caliper back in AND turn it at the same
time, so don't use a c-clamp on the rear brakes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your caliper may look slightly different.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/braketool.jpg" width="531" height="593"></p>

<p>Remove the phillips set screw in the rotor (marked with red arrow below) and remove the rotor.&nbsp;
If the screw is rusty, spray it with some penetrating lubricant like PB Blaster
to loosen it.&nbsp; They seem to strip easily.&nbsp; If it's bad you may have to drill the head off or use a stripped
screw extractor.&nbsp; Take care to not damage the hub if you do strip it.&nbsp; If the rotor is
still stuck from rust or corrosion, tap it lightly with a rubber hammer or a piece of
wood to break it loose.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/brake2.jpg" width="582" height="396"></p>

<p>This was after removal, you can see the the two holes for the caliper allen bolts
on the left.&nbsp; The ring with holes is part of the ABS sensor.&nbsp; If your
ABS goes nuts after you do a brake job you know something was damaged.&nbsp;
Check the ring and sensor for damage.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/brake3.jpg" width="633" height="417"></p>

<h3>Installation of brake pads and rotors on VW Jetta TDI and similar</h3>

<p>Scrub any rust off the hub with a wire brush and put a light coat of
anti-seize around the lug holes and especially the set screw hole to help prevent
corrosion.&nbsp;
Excessive rust could cause the hub to not seat flat, causing minor wheel
vibration and other problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b> Note</b> - the service manual wheel bolt torque
specs do not call for anti-seize but stuck bolts is a problem in areas where
they may be exposed to road salting in the winter or corrosion.&nbsp; If you use
antiseize, lower the torque spec slightly by the amount indicated by the anti
seize technical data sheet.&nbsp; If you can't figure it out, lower the torque
spec by 5% if using antiseize.&nbsp; This is on the tight side but the greater
of two evils is seized lugs, at least in the Northeast where they salt the
roads, vs. stripped hubs or lugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clean the various parts with brake cleaner, pop in the new brake pads, lube
the slide pins and the back of the brake pads with a very light coat of brake
grease.&nbsp; Apply anti-seize to the bolt threads and
reinstall everything.&nbsp; Do not apply brake grease to the pad or rotor
friction surfaces.&nbsp; If this occurs, wipe it clean with brake cleaner fluid.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Make sure the new brake pads look like the ones that were removed and fit
correctly.</p>

<p>Make sure that any electrical plugs for the ABS or brake pad wear sensors have been put back and that everything is
sitting level.</p>

<p>Go for a test drive to double check for any fluid leaks and proper braking
action.</p>

<h3>Torque specs:</h3>

<p>
guide pins (the 7mm allen bolts:) 22 ft-lbs<br>
rotor set screw : 3 ft-lbs&nbsp; Just tighten it very lightly and make sure the screw
head is level and not sticking out<br>
lug nuts: 89 ft-lbs (dry spec)</p>

<p>I didn't have a good pic of the mk4 car so here is an
mk3 car.<br>

<h3>Rear brakes:</h3>

<p>Since replacing the rear brakes is similar to the front brakes, I will
only note the differences.</p>

<p>Use pliers to remove the parking brake cable retaining clip (marked in green
below, just pull it out), and slip out
the parking brake cable.&nbsp; You will probably have to move the parking brake
lever around on the caliper to get it out.&nbsp; The parking brake lever in
the cabin must be off so that there is no tension on the cable.</p>

<p>Remove the caliper bolts (13mm x2 bolts outlined in red).&nbsp; The factory service manual says that these bolts must be replaced each time they are
removed!&nbsp; The caliper bolts
must be counter held with the guide pin nuts (15mm x2 outlined in yellow)&nbsp;
You can now place the caliper off to the side.&nbsp; Again, don't let the caliper hang by the brake line, always support it or tie
it to something with a piece of string.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/rearbrake1.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>

<p>Here is another view of the caliper after removal.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/vw-jetta-rear-brake.jpg" width="500" height="422"></p>

<p>Remove the rotor set screw.&nbsp; Loosen the carrier bolts (8mm 2x allen) just enough to
remove the rotor.&nbsp; Remove rotor.&nbsp; Here is a picture of the rear
caliper from the top.&nbsp; The
brake carrier bolts are outlined in blue, the caliper bolts marked again in red, and the
nuts which you have to counterhold marked again in yellow.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/rbrake.jpg" width="536" height="400"></p>

<p>Here is a picture of the rear carrier after removal.&nbsp; Inspect the pins
for binding, torn boots, and free motion.&nbsp; Grease as needed.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/vw-brake-carrier-pin.jpg" width="500" height="427"></p>

<p>The rear caliper pistons are slightly different from the front brakes in that you
can't just push the pistons back into the caliper with a c-clamp.&nbsp; You must turn it while pushing
it back.&nbsp; Use VW special tool 3272 or something similar from Autozone or
Advance.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/b5/susp/vw-caliper-tool.jpg" width="1015" height="300"></p>

<p>Below is a video explaining why  you should always use the parking
brake.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nPRNbn9bdJg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Again, scrape any rust off, use brake cleaner to clean the seals and
surfaces, then use
new brake grease or anti-seize as appropriate.</p>

<p>Installation is the reverse of removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Press the brake and pull the handbrake several times to reset their
positions.&nbsp; Go for a test drive to double check for fluid leaks
and proper brake and parking brake actuation.</p>

<p><b>Torque specs:</b><br>
brake caliper bolts - these are self locking bolts. The factory
service manual says that they are one use only, torque to: 26 ft lbs.&nbsp; If
you don't have replacements and the bolts are clean, not rusty or damaged, have
never been overtightened, and with good threads, you could probably reuse them
with new threadlocker.&nbsp; Warning: reuse them at your own risk!<br>
8mm brake carrier bolts: 48 ft lbs<br>
rotor set screw: 3 ft lbs - very light, just make sure the screw head isn't sticking out<br>
lug nuts: 89 ft lbs (dry spec)</p>
