<h1>Water pump and temperature sensor replacement for mk4 VW TDI engine, ALH or
BEW</h1>

    <p><a href="../multi/difficulty_scale.htm">
Difficulty: 3/5</a></p>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>

<h2>This shows how to replace the water pump or coolant temp sensor on your mk4 VW TDI engine.</h2>

<p>
This article is rated difficulty 3 only because the timing belt must be removed
to get access.&nbsp; If you're only removing the water pump without replacing
the timing belt, the only difference is that you don't have to remove the motor
mount.&nbsp; The motor mount can stay in place while you work around it.&nbsp;
Once the belt is removed it's very
easy, just remove 3 bolts and the pump will come out.</p>

<p>The water pump removal and installation procedure is the same on both ALH and
BEW engines so this article is linked to both timing belt writeups.&nbsp; Ignore
any small differences in the pictures vs. your engine because the procedure is
the same.&nbsp; The actual water pumps are different though.</p>

<p><b>Caution</b> - do not use green
prestone coolant, you should use VW G12/G12+ or compatible coolant, see <a href="coolant-flush-TDI.htm">1000q:
coolant flush</a> for more details.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>I suggest a metal impeller water pump.&nbsp; The plastic impeller water pumps
sometimes separate from the shaft.&nbsp; If this happens the engine will
overheat with no other symptoms because no coolant is circulating.&nbsp; Replacement requires timing belt
removal.</p>

<h3>Water pump replacement procedure</h3>

<p>Drain the coolant as needed and remove the timing belt.&nbsp; For non pumpe duse cars,
model years 1998-2003, ALH engine, refer to <a href="ALH-engine-timing-belt-change-VW-Jetta-TDI-1.htm">1000q:
ALH timing
belt part 1-removal</a>.&nbsp; For pumpe duse cars with BEW engine and a mk4
body, model year 2004-2006, see <a href="vw-jetta-tdi-timing-belt-change-replacement-bew-engine.htm">1000q: timing
belt replacement BEW - removal</a>.&nbsp; I suggest replacing most of the coolant since
most will be drained anyways.&nbsp; Have 3 liters/1 gallon of coolant and an
equal amount of distilled water handy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Open the radiator drain valve at the bottom corner of the radiator.&nbsp; If your car does not have one, remove
the lower radiator hose.<br>

<p><b>Optional</b>: Remove the lower (or both) oil filter housing coolant hoses.&nbsp; Twist the
hoses to break the seal first.&nbsp; This will make it much easier to pull them
off.&nbsp; Then apply compressed air to the coolant reservoir.&nbsp; This will
blow out a little bit of coolant in the oil cooler and engine.<br>

<p>Remove the (3x 10mm) bolts holding the water pump.&nbsp; Here is a picture
of the water pump removed to show the location of the bolts. NOTE: If this is being replaced with the timing belt service the large roller and stretch bolt will have been removed (as shown below). If you're not replacing the timing belt at this time, have a replacement stretch bolt for the pulley. The part number is in the ALH timing belt article.<br>

<p>Here is the backside of a metal impeller water pump.<br>

<p>If it's stuck, use a block of wood to gently tap it out, alternating on the top and bottom
until the water pump is loose.&nbsp; Do not hit it hard or use a screwdriver to pry it out because this will damage the metal surfaces.&nbsp; Then just
wiggle/pull it out.&nbsp;
Some
coolant will come splashing out, so have paper towels and a catch pan below the pump.&nbsp;
If it's stuck, <a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/Default.asp" target="_blank">dieselgeek</a> sells a water pump removal tool which sits in the 10mm
bolt holes and pushes the water pump out.&nbsp; These are shown in use below. <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/waterpump4.jpg" width="444" height="328"></p>
<p>Wipe away any excess coolant and leaking grease or oil.&nbsp; Make sure the old
o-ring is removed! If there is excess rust you can use a soft scrubber or paper towel to clean the area. Do not use anything which could scratch the metal.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/waterpump5.jpg" width="540" height="470"></p>
<p>Visually inspect the pump and water pump cavity to make sure there's nothing left behind like broken vanes! In one case, someone found a defect in the block which was causing a slow leak. <a href="http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f5/alh-water-pump-leakage-21541/">They fixed it with RTV, here is the post</a>.</p>
<p>Blow out any bolt holes that have spilled coolant in them. This will make sure  a bolt being tightened on top of the coolant can't hydrolock.</p>
<p>If you removed the motor mount it may be easier to put the new belt on, then
the motor mount, then the water pump.&nbsp; I usually work around the motor
mount instead - if you did this, continue to work around it.</p>
<p>To install the new water pump, use some coolant to lubricate the o-ring and press the new pump
in place.&nbsp; Make sure to lubricate the o-ring or else it could twist
or get pinched and spring a coolant leak.&nbsp; Do not use liquid gasket maker.</p>
<p>Torque the 3 bolts to 11 ft lbs.</p>
