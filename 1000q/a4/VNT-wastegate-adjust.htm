<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows how to test or replace the turbo actuator on a   TDI
engine (vacuum actuator)</h2>
<p> All mk4 and newer VW TDI Jetta, Golf, Passat, and New Beetle use vacuum actuated rod
to move the vanes inside the VNT turbo.&nbsp; A sticky turbo actuator can cause
limp mode by not moving the vanes as the car computer expects.&nbsp; Dealers
usually replace the entire turbo because they make more money and it increases the chance of fixing the symptoms in 1
visit.&nbsp; This is because the vanes inside the turbo or the vane control ring
inside the turbo can also be bad and cause the same symptoms.</p>
<p> The VNT actuator looks like a wastegate can and uses a lever to
  move the VNT vanes inside the turbo.&nbsp; VNT actuator and wastegates are similar in location and
  appearance so don't get
  confused if you see the term wastegate used instead of VNT actuator.&nbsp; The
  biggest difference between them is that a wastegate can
  uses pressure to work and is found only on non-VNT turbos.&nbsp; The VNT actuator uses vacuum to suck its rod in. Related links: <a href="../multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">1000q: fixing limp mode</a>
  and <a href="../multi/low-power-fix-TDI.htm">1000q: constant low power or can't rev</a>.&nbsp;
  Also see <a href="turbo-removal-TDI-engine.htm">1000q: ALH/BEW turbo removal</a> and <a href="VNT-turbo-removal-vanes.htm">1000q:
turbo vane cleaning</a>.</p>
<p> It's possible to adjust the VNT rod to adjust its movement but before you
try this, carefully check and replace all vacuum lines and other
possible maintenance items.&nbsp; If it was working fine before, do not adjust
the VNT rod.&nbsp; Only adjust the VNT rod if it was out of adjustment before or
you are modifying the turbo or turbo setup.&nbsp; Adjusting it when it doesn't
need adjusting will not improve turbo response or fuel economy and could cause
dangerous boost spikes or lack of response.</p>
<p> Other non pumpe duse mk4 TDI engines are similar.&nbsp; 2004-2006 mk4
pumpe duse 1.9L TDI, 2005-2006 mk5 Jetta, and 2009+ common rail 2.0L TDI use an actuator with a sensor to see rod position.&nbsp;
A common problem with these is broken wiring at the actuator.&nbsp; Carefully
inspect the wiring if you have a 2004+ Jetta/Golf/NB.</p>
<p><strong>FOR THE BEW ENGINE</strong>, see <a href="vnt-actuator-bew-engine.htm">1000q: BEW actuator replacement</a>.</p>
<p>2004-2005
  mk4 Passat TDI use the non-sensor can.</p>
<p> Garrett (GT) and Borg-Warner (KKK) turbo actuators work in different directions.  Garrett actuators  suck in the rod with vac vs. push out the rod with vac. My mk5  BRM engine Borg Warner actuator pushes out starting around 3&quot; vac and is fully extended around 17-18&quot;.</p>
<p>VW Touareg and Audi Q7 use an
  electric actuator for the turbo so the testing and diagnosis is completely different.</p>
<p>If you find the tips on this page helpful, please use the donation button at the top so that I can continue to keep publishing great articles for free. The Bentley service manual is about $80 and doesn't even mention this repair - it just tells you to replace the entire turbo! This page has videos,  color pictures, and greater detail. I know it's saved many people from a much more expensive repair. Thanks in advance!</p>
<h3> How the VNT turbo actuator should work </h3>
<p> The lever on the outside is welded to a lever inside the turbo
housing.&nbsp; This is how it moves the VNT vanes.&nbsp; See the below videos to
see how smoothly and free the lever should move.&nbsp; It should not stick or
bind at all.&nbsp; Vacuum is being applied to the can, not pressure.&nbsp; When
there's no vacuum (engine off), the rod is fully extended because the spring
inside the can is pushing it open.&nbsp; As engine rpm goes up and more turbo
boost is requested by the car's computer, the N75
solenoid allows vacuum pressure to go to the can and the rod retracts under vacuum pressure.&nbsp;
In other words, at full vacuum, the lever should be at the stop screw (not
visible).&nbsp; This moves the internal vanes and gives more boost.&nbsp; At full rest, the rod should be fully extended but not hitting anything.&nbsp;
Because this relies on vacuum pressure, it's essential that the vacuum lines and
N75 solenoid/wiring are working and not leaking.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QdqMmB3hxTM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p> The lever moves a ring and the ring moves the vanes.&nbsp; These vanes
change the angle and speed of exhaust hitting the turbine wheel.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu0UGKS7-JQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Here's a newer video I made. A Borg Warner turbo is shown so there's some differences with the Garrett turbo shown above but the overall operation is similar.<br><iframe width="853" height="480" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Ppif4qC560U?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p> Again, dealers prefer to replace the entire TDI turbo and actuator as a unit
because it costs more and because it also rules out any internal turbo/VNT vane
sticking problem.&nbsp; Below is an example of a sticking actuator.&nbsp; It
holds vacuum but doesn't have full or smooth movement.<br>

</p>
<p>Here is a video showing  good actuator movement.<br><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZaNxPQhIdjU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p><font color="black">Once the engine is fully warmed up, you should rev the engine high and hard
  on a regular basis, like when entering highway on ramps
  (always observe posted speed limits), to raise exhaust gas temperatures (EGT).&nbsp; Raising EGT will burn up and blow
  out carbon and soot build up out of the VNT vanes and help prevent them
  from getting stuck.&nbsp; Only do this once the engine is fully warmed up and
  let the car cool down with a period of normal driving afterwards.&nbsp; The key
  is both high rpm and high load.&nbsp; High load at low rpm or high rpm in
  neutral with no load will not raise EGT high enough and long enough to burn up
  the soot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="black"> Before you order a replacement VNT actuator, spray some penetrating lubricant around the VNT lever as described
  below and go for a few hard runs.&nbsp; You might go into limp mode a
  few times but it's free and it may solve the issue if the problem is only minor soot
  buildup.</font>&nbsp; <font color="black">The problem isn't from only vane movement because if you
    monitor VNT movement through VCDS, it reaches full movement at a relatively low
    RPM.&nbsp; The key is both high rpm and high load (temperatures) to burn up and blow
    out the buildup.&nbsp; Another problem is corrosion buildup around the adjuster
ring inside the turbo.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">Limp mode with underboost is safer than limp mode with
overboost.&nbsp; Have the car scanned for codes and use a
boost gauge to confirm which you are getting.</font></p>

<p>Note - The ALH engine (1998-2003 TDI) is a little different from the BEW engine's
(2004-2006 4th gen TDI) VNT actuator because the BEW's actuator has the &quot;G500
sensor&quot; to determine vane position.&nbsp; This is also called the smart actuator. See additional notes below.</p>
<p> VNT actuator for ALH engine (up to 2003): VW# 038 198 716, available from <font color="black"><a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-213/VNT-Actuator/Detail">kermatdi

</a></font> </p>
<p> <font color="black">1 circlip/e-clips for the actuator lever and 1 spare - no VW# available but
a 1/4&quot; e-clip should work.&nbsp; The spare is for when the first one flies
off and disappears.&nbsp; If you know the correct size/shape, please post your
comment in the <a href="../../forum/index.php">myturbodiesel forums</a>, thank

<p> <font color="black">
I avoid any actuator sold by <img border="0" src="../../images/badseller.png" width="452" height="21">since
it's almost certainly a cheap copycat part.&nbsp; I also had a bad experience
with this seller so never again.</font> </p>
<p><font color="black">The Garrett part comes with a clip taped to the box as
shown right.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">If you have the BEW or similar engine (2004+) you need
the smart sensor actuator.&nbsp; There is no official VW part number for it
because VW does not sell these separately from the turbo.&nbsp; Borg Warner doesn't sell them either. They can be purchased from <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-83/The-%22Smart%22-actuator-for/Detail" target="_blank">kermatdi
smart VNT TDI actuator</a> and custom modified to fit</font>.</p>
<p>There is no BRM actuator available but you can make a custom bracket to attach the CBEA/CJAA actuator. It will work fine.  The Borg Warner (KKK) actuator rods suck out instead of sucking in because the spring is on the other side of the rubber diaphragm.</p>
<p>CBEA engine turbos have an actuator available, VW# 03L 198 716 a. This should also fit CJAA engines.</p>
<p><b><font size="4">Procedure
</font></b></p>
<h3><b>First confirm bad VNT or isolate another problem</b></h3>
<p>First confirm the diagnosis of a sticking VNT actuator because it could also
be a sticking turbo VNT vane, bad n75 solenoid, or leaking vacuum line.</p>
<p> Have a
helper turn on the car and the VNT lever should move.&nbsp; If you have a <a href="http://ross-tech.com/" target="_blank">VCDS
cable from ross tech</a>, <font color="black">with the engine running, click on
&quot;engine&quot; and then &quot;output tests&quot;.&nbsp; One of the tests is
N75 test cycle.&nbsp; This cycles the n75 solenoid, VNT, and vacuum
line.</font></p>
<p><font color="black">A common problem is soot and carbon
clogging the VNT vanes which causes the same symptom as a sticking VNT
lever.&nbsp; See <a href="VNT-turbo-removal-vanes.htm">1000q: clean turbo VNT vanes</a> to
see a detailed cleaning procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="black">Through VCDS, log requested boost vs. actual boost.&nbsp;
To do this, plug in your VCDS cable to the obd2 port under dashboard, near the
steering wheel.&nbsp; Click on &quot;engine&quot;.&nbsp; Then click on &quot;measuring blocks&quot;
in the below screen.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/IQadjust1.jpg" width="630" height="449"></font></p>
<p><font color="black">Then click &quot;up&quot; or enter 11 to view &quot;group 11&quot;
and graph to see the below screen.&nbsp; If it's
not close then this could indicate a defective or clogged VNT actuator, N75
solenoid, vac lines, or
sticking vanes.&nbsp; Here is an example of a good N75 solenoid-vac lines-VNT
actuator-clean turbo.&nbsp; Suddenly stomping on the accelerator pedal will
produce spikes - this is normal.&nbsp; Smooth, normal acceleration should produce
minimal spikes.&nbsp; A healthy ALH engine should see a spike and then see the
boost settle down to about 1900 mbar.&nbsp; Swap the N75 solenoid with the EGR solenoid as a test to
isolate a possible solenoid problem and check the vacuum lines.&nbsp; This will
isolate a boost problem to the VNT actuator or internal vanes.&nbsp; To further
isolate those, do the tests below.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/goodmap.jpg" width="627" height="501"></font></p>
<p><font color="black">First put a few
drops of PB Blaster on the VNT lever and then go for a test drive.&nbsp; This
may loosen surface rust enough to get correct movement.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;You
may have to remove the rubber elbow before the intake manifold and turbo intake
plastic hard pipe for clearance.&nbsp; Below is a picture of the passenger side with those hoses
removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;While this won't free a seized VNT vane, it won't hurt
anything either.&nbsp; Warm up the engine and then go for some very hard runs as
described above.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vnt1.jpg" width="720" height="540"></p>
<p>Here is the turbo out of the car for illustration (as if you were looking at
the back of the engine).&nbsp; Put a few drops of PB Blaster around the
lever and circlip to help them move smoothly.&nbsp; (There's a heatshield around
the can, not pictured).&nbsp; If you try to press the lever down by hand, you
should feel smooth, consistent resistance from the spring inside the VNT
actuator.&nbsp; After you release the lever, the spring should immediately push it back up to the top resting
position.&nbsp; Full travel from the stop is about 1cm and can be seen in the
above videos.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vnt2.jpg" width="720" height="634"></p>
<p>Follow the vac line to the N75 solenoid valve (solenoid is mounted on
  middle of firewall - look above the brake fluid reservoir).&nbsp; Remove the
  vacuum line at the N75 solenoid valve and apply vacuum to the line.&nbsp; The
  rod should move smoothly beginning at about 3-5&quot; vac and hitting the stop at
  18-22&quot;.&nbsp; Full travel from the stop is about 1cm.&nbsp; You can also use
  your hand (on a cold non running engine only!) to feel the rod move as you apply
vacuum to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should move smoothly with no binding or clicking.</p>
<p>For reference, here are the BRM engine's (2005.5-2006 Jetta TDI) actuator
specs: during the test, do not exceed 750 mbar.&nbsp; The linkage should
start moving at around 300 mbar and be at the end at about 700 mbar.&nbsp; The
actuator lift should be 10mm.</p>
<p>If the VNT actuator is not holding vacuum then the VNT actuator is bad (since
you've already checked and rechecked the vacuum lines).&nbsp; Replace it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's binding, clicking, or not moving at all, remove the actuator rod from
the VNT lever.&nbsp; This will let you isolate and test the VNT lever's movement.&nbsp; If it's seized then you
have to remove the turbo and clean the vanes.&nbsp; See <a href="VNT-turbo-removal-vanes.htm">1000q:
turbo vane cleaning</a> and <a href="turbo-removal-TDI-engine.htm">1000q: turbo removal
ALH / BEW</a>.&nbsp; When the vanes stick too much, the internal lever and ring
wear into each other and stick/create play.</p>
