<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows the jack points and lift points on my 2003 Jetta VW TDI.&nbsp;</h2>
<p> This information
applies to my car and my exact situation only, your car may be in different
condition, different year cars may be different, your equipment may be
different, your car may be loaded differently, your driveway/garage surface may
be different, etc., so take all these factors and any other pertinent information
for safety raising your car for your exact situation.&nbsp;
Refer
to the <a href="../../TOS.htm"> TOS Agreement</a> for the full legal disclaimer.&nbsp;
Damage to your property, injury, and death, or to a 3rd party are possible
consequences of not supporting your vehicle properly and/or securely.&nbsp;
Never place yourself or anyone else in a position where you could be injured by an improperly supported
car.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you are not experienced in jacking up and supporting other makes and
models of cars or are not 100% sure on how to jack up your car and safely
support your car based on the factory service manual and your own previous
experience, consult a professional
local mechanic or another local person who is qualified to help and supervise
you.&nbsp; It's not worth your life to take any safety risks when raising the
car!</p>
<h3>Safety rules I always follow for getting under the car:</h3>
<p>If you have any doubt that the car is not secure during or after raising it,
there is no doubt.&nbsp; Secure it more.&nbsp; After you're sure, double check
the jack stands by visual inspection and by shaking the car.&nbsp; Then visually
triple check it.&nbsp; It should be stable and the car must not shift on the
jack stands at all.</p>
<p>Never get under the car far enough to get injured while raising, lowering,
    or adjusting the car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Always check the jack during and after raising, lowering, or adjusting the car to make sure it's not slipping
    or moving.&nbsp; When lifting one side or end, have a helper watch the other
side because a common mistake is for it to move on the end you can't see.&nbsp;
Always reinspect the supports after moving the car.<p>Never get under the car far enough to get injured if the car's weight is
    not securely resting on jack stands.&nbsp; For example, hydraulic jacks are only for
    raising the car to where you can put jack stands under it because it's not
    safe to rest the car's weight on a hydraulic jack.&nbsp; A hydraulic jack can blow a
    seal, break, fail, etc., and this can kill you.<p>Make sure your equipment and the car's jack points are in good
    condition.&nbsp; Also inspect the driveway/garage condition because jack
    stands can dig into hot asphalt.<p> Always make sure your equipment is
    suitable and rated for the car that you're using it on.<p>Never rest the weight of the car on the suspension or axle - these are
    designed to move and are not safe jack points.<p>After raising the car, shake it a bit to check that it's
    secure.
    <p>I always use a backup to jack stands since it's not worth betting your
    life that the jack stand won't fail.&nbsp; Another pair of jack stands and using the
    hydraulic jack to just where it lightly holds the car (not supporting the
    car's weight) are the minimum backups that I use.
    <p>Apply the parking brake and put the car in gear as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also
    chock the wheels so that the car can't roll.<p>Some of my wheel chocks are these rain
    gutter guides - they fit perfectly on the wheel and are heavy enough to prevent
movement.&nbsp; When I'm done they even get to go back to being rain gutter
guides!<br>
    <img border="0" src="../../images/misc/wheelchock.jpg" width="326" height="335">
<p>The &quot;widowmaker&quot; scissor jack in your car is for emergency roadside wheel removal and is
    not a substitute for a floor jack or jack stands.&nbsp; They are not
    sufficient to safely support a car and at no time while
    changing a wheel on the side of the road should you get under the car far
    enough to be injured because they can fail.<br>
    <img border="0" src="../../images/brojack.jpg" width="649" height="402">
<p>NEVER use cinder blocks to carry the weight of a car or as substitute for
    proper car jack stands.&nbsp; Cinder blocks are stronger in one orientation
    and weak in the other - do you know which one is the strong direction?&nbsp;
    If you don't and have used cinder blocks to support the car you've
unnecessarily risked
    your life.&nbsp; Cinder blocks supporting weight
    should always have plywood placed between the weight and the block to spread
    the load out.&nbsp; Focusing the load can cause cinder blocks to suddenly
    shatter.&nbsp; Cinder blocks also don't show cracks, weaknesses, or defects
    well.
<p>Don't get complacent in safety checks!&nbsp; That one time you say
    &quot;it's good enough&quot; could be when the accident occurs, like shown
    below (not mine).&nbsp; Luckily no one was injured in the case pictured, but that crushed oil pan could be your
    chest and that oil could be your splattered brains.&nbsp; For your sake, discipline and fear can help prevent complacency.<br>

When lifting from the frame rail, I use a piece of solid, even, and secure 2x4 wood between the hydraulic jack
    and frame rail to avoid damaging/pinching the frame rail.&nbsp; Make sure
    it's centered or else it can slip.
<p>I use a thin piece of cardboard between the jack and car to prevent
    it from scratching the car.
<p>I rest the jack stand on top of a solid, even, and secure piece of
    wood to raise its height and prevent digging into my driveway.&nbsp; Once
    the car's weight is being carried through the jack stand, the wood is
    effectively pushed firmly to the ground.
<p>I have a safety helper double check my setup and assist in case anything
    else does go wrong.
<p>My personal hydraulic jack is the costco 3 ton &quot;arcan&quot; aluminum
    jack.&nbsp; Not every store may carry it.&nbsp; It's about 58 lbs vs. 100
    lbs for a comparable steel jack, has a lower padded bar to avoid scratching
    your car, is about $145 after everything, and has a range of 3.7-19.3&quot;
    so it will fit under most lowered cars but lift high too.&nbsp; It is not a
    racing &quot;quick drop&quot; jack so lowering it is safe and controlled, I avoid racing jacks in general.&nbsp; It also has a quick lift feature.&nbsp;
    My experience with Craftsman jacks is that they tend to leak and stop lifting after a while due to dirt
    clogging an internal valve.&nbsp; They can be cleaned and rebuilt but I
    avoid craftsman jacks now because of their current design.
<p>The jack stand can rest on the pinch weld highlighted in green below.&nbsp; There is a stamped triangle on the lower sill right
above the reinforced pinch weld to indicate where it is.&nbsp; This is also
where you place the roadside emergency scissor jack.&nbsp; The pinch weld areas highlighted in red are not reinforced and you should not place a
jack stand there.&nbsp; Some cars have a corrugated look to the reinforced
area.&nbsp; If you use a hydraulic jack
on the sill you should use
an adapter to securely hold the sill.&nbsp; You can use a small piece of wood or
a hockey puck with a groove cut it it to match the sill.&nbsp; Since you're
making the adapter yourself, you take all responsibility for the design and
safety of any adapter.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/vwjackpoint3.JPG" width="720" height="415"></p>
<p>The area just inboard of it highlighted in green is reinforced but you must
use a piece of wood (to spread out the weight) between the body and
hydraulic jack to raise the car.&nbsp; You can also use a piece of wood between the frame
rail and hydraulic jack to raise the car.&nbsp; The hole in the body is the spot for installing
OEM jack pads.&nbsp;
These are factory parts that you install in the small hole for use with 4 post car lifts.&nbsp;
I don't use them because I already have jack
stands and a good jack and because they are designed for use with 4 post car
lifts.&nbsp; Do not place the jack stand on the jack pad.</p>
<p>I put a small piece of cardboard between the jack and car to
help prevent marring.&nbsp; The previous owner didn't use anything to protect the body so the frame rails have some
dents.<br>

<p>Here is another photo showing my car's front passenger side after raising it.&nbsp; The
weight of the car is on the jack stands at the factory jack stand
location.&nbsp; The hydraulic jack is for backup only and is only lightly
touching the frame rail - it is not carrying the weight of the car!&nbsp;
Hydraulic jacks can fail or blow a seal, suddenly releasing the car, so never be
in a position to be injured while a hydraulic jack is carrying the weight of the
car.&nbsp; The other side has another jack and jackstand to secure that
side.&nbsp; The rear wheels are also chocked.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/vwjackpoint2.JPG" width="900" height="464"></p>
<p>Here is the pinch weld jack point on the rear.&nbsp; It's also below a
stamped triangle on the sill.<br>
