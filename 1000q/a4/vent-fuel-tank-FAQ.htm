<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>All mk3 and mk4 VW TDI used a fuel tank vent in the fuel filler neck to vent
air out.&nbsp; Venting is when you press on the vent to release trapped air to
add more fuel to the tank, extending your car's range per tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> Look
inside the filler neck and you can see a button, see below for detailed pics.&nbsp;
Press on it when the tank is almost full and you will hear the hiss of air
venting.&nbsp; This lets you add about 2 extra gallons of fuel.&nbsp; Venting does not
increase fuel economy at all, it just lets you add a little more fuel to
increase miles per tank.&nbsp; You can also remove the vent's spring loaded internals so that you don't have
to press on the button making venting faster.&nbsp; This is shown in this
article.&nbsp; This does not apply to mk5
cars (2005.5+ Jetta).</p>
<p>Warning: Do not do it on a gasoline car.&nbsp; Gasoline vapors are flammable
and should not be released to the atmosphere.&nbsp; A gasoline fuel tank is connected to the engine emissions
system and they burn these vapors.&nbsp; Removing the vent or otherwise altering
the fuel filler neck could cause a fire hazard!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The TDI vent
only connects the filler neck and the fuel tank.&nbsp; It's not connected to
anything else like an emissions system.&nbsp; This is because diesel is a
heavier fuel than gasoline and the vapors are not flammable at room temperature
and pressure.&nbsp; This procedure doesn't release any extra diesel vapors and
later Jetta/Golf TDI fuel tanks are vented to the atmosphere anyways.&nbsp; Venting also
works on b2 passat and a2 jetta diesel but those are pre-TDI and outside the
scope of this article.&nbsp; The vent is normally opened with you put the fuel
cap back on.</p>
<p>The only problem venting could cause is if you were to fill the tank all the
way up to the very top of the filler neck and then park the car in the heat.&nbsp;
Heated diesel expands much less than gasoline so the likelihood of overflowing
fuel is very low but spilled diesel can melt asphalt and should be immediately
cleaned up.&nbsp; Vent at your own risk!&nbsp; If you vented all the way, just
drive a little bit to lower the fuel level and you should not have any problem
with fuel spills.&nbsp; Disclaimer: As with any other information on this
website, it is done at your own risk!&nbsp; This website is not responsible for
damage to your driveway, any persons and/or property resulting from any tips you
found here!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
Truck high flow fuel pumps
      are larger and can
cause foaming if you fill at their max speed.&nbsp; The high flow large pumps
will not fit all the way into the mk5 filler neck due to a blocking rib.&nbsp;
The mk5 cars don't use this vent anyways.
      <p>Do not attempt this on a gasoline car because it is part of their emissions
system, gasoline evaporates much more, and it can create a fire hazard.&nbsp;
The air space may also help prevent fuel spills in a crash when the tank is
      full, especially important
with a gas car since gas is more volatile than diesel.&nbsp; The gasoline vapors
are normally trapped and burned in a gas car and the vent helps route vented gas
back to the fuel nozzle instead of into the atmosphere.&nbsp; The TDI does not
use a &quot;carbon canister&quot; or &quot;evaporative emissions&quot;
system.&nbsp;
      <p>While you are working on the fuel door, here is another mod to make it
      pop open much further when you press the release button: <a href="fuel-door-mod.htm">1000q:

<h3>Procedure for mk4 Jetta, Golf, New Beetle, and Passat TDI</h3>

-&nbsp; additional notes for New Beetle below</p>
<p>Here is a video with the fuel tank removed for
illustration.&nbsp; Not shown is backflushing the vent of any dirt before
putting the vent body back.&nbsp; Below are detailed instructions.<font size="4"><b><br>
<iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/If0z8UnIZkc?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></b></font></p>
<p>Open the fuel filler door and remove the T-20 torx bolt by the filler door lock.&nbsp;
Remove the filler cap and stuff a clean paper towel down the fuel filler to avoid getting dirt inside.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/vent/vent8.jpg" width="630" height="402"></p>
<p>Pivot the rubber surround boot out and to the right.&nbsp; As you pull it out
you will have to pull the entire assembly to the left.&nbsp; The fuel
filler door comes out with it.&nbsp; Set aside to get more room.&nbsp; The latch strike can also be pulled off.&nbsp;
Pinch the sides and slide it off the latch solenoid button.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/vent/vent9.jpg" width="576" height="422"></p>
<p>There is a small tab on the rear of the vent body, push up on it (white
arrow) while pushing the vent button towards the rear of the car (the direction
of the yellow arrow).&nbsp;&nbsp; This should push the white plastic vent
out.&nbsp; Pictured below is the vent body halfway out.&nbsp; The 2004-2005 VW
Passat TDI fuel vent body is black instead of white.&nbsp; Clean
the o-rings and backflush the vent tube to prevent dirt from getting pushed in
when you put the vent back.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/vent/vent6.jpg" width="709" height="561"></p>
<p>You don't push the black plastic tube out, only the black button and the
parts inside the black plastic tube.&nbsp; It will look like this (below).&nbsp;
There are two tabs holding the vent internals in the vent body, pull them
slightly out and the vent internals should come out under spring pressure.&nbsp;
You can discard or keep the vent internals.&nbsp;
Marked with a white arrow below was where you had to push up during the last
step (vent is upside down).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/vent/jetvent2.jpg" width="701" height="410"></p>
<p>Backflush the vent tube with carb or brake cleaner (not water) to keep the
vent tube clean.</p>
<p>Put the vent body back (minus the internals) and make sure the white tab
snaps the vent body back in place.&nbsp; The vent internals are now removed,
letting you vent faster and easier.</p>
<h3>New beetle TDI fuel tank vent additional notes</h3>
<p>You can remove the vent in the NB 2 ways.&nbsp; The first way is identical to
the above instructions.&nbsp; The second way may be easier, you remove the right
taillight to get access to the back of the vent.&nbsp; Instructions for the NB
are below.</p>
<p>Open the rear hatch and pry off the oval taillight cover on the inside of the
car.&nbsp; Unscrew the plastic knob that holds the taillight in
place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insert a screwdriver at the 8 o'clock position looking at the light to
release a metal clip holding the taillight. Remove the taillight.&nbsp; If the
taillight doesn't come out easily, the clip is still holding the
taillight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now access the vent body from the rear instead of removing the fuel
filler door and rubber surround.&nbsp; The rest of the instructions are
identical to the above.&nbsp; Below is a picture of the vent as viewed through
the rear taillight position.</p>
