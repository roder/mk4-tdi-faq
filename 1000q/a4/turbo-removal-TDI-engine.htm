<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows turbo removal on an ALH engine Jetta/Golf.&nbsp; New
Beetle is similar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p> Although the BEW is slightly different, the procedure
is similar, see your factory service manual for the differences.&nbsp; Many
times low power or the turbo cutting out is misdiagnosed as a bad turbo.&nbsp;
If you have these symptoms, see <a href="../multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">1000q: limp
mode diagnosis</a> and <a href="../multi/low-power-fix-TDI.htm">1000q: constant low
power or can't rev</a>.&nbsp; If you want to swap the turbo to make more power,
see <a href="../tditurbo.htm">1000q: TDI turbo upgrade chart</a>.&nbsp;
Difficulty is only rated 2/5 because it's not technically difficult and doesn't
require any special tools other than the normal shop tools.&nbsp; However, it's
time consuming and you might run into complications so be prepared.</p>

<p>The easiest way to remove the turbo is from above because of clearance.&nbsp;
The turbo and exhaust manifold are 1 piece.&nbsp; This also gives you the chance
to clean the intake manifold of carbon.&nbsp; It might be faster to remove the
turbo from below but you would have to remove the passenger side driveshaft.&nbsp;
There's also less clearance and there'll be lots of rusty chips falling onto you
so I suggest removal from above, as described in this article.&nbsp; Always wear
eye protection, note all cautions in your factory service manual, and see the
TOS Agreement for the legal disclaimer.</p>

<p>ALH engine is 1998-2003, BEW engine is 2004-2006 TDI</p>

<h3>Parts/Tools</h3>
<p>Note: service manual says in one place to always replace BEW engine's
downpipe nuts, in another place it has no such
note, ALH also has no such note.&nbsp; While you can reuse the nuts if they are in
good condition, good practice is to buy new self locking nuts.&nbsp; You're also
supposed to use new exhaust gaskets but if you're missing one they can be
reused.&nbsp; I wouldn't since they're cheap and replacement would require you
to remove the turbo again.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Raise the front of the car, chock the rear wheels, <a href="jackpoints.htm">rest
the car on jack stands</a>, make sure the car is safe and secure before getting
under it at all!</p>
<p><a href="clean-intake-manifold-VW-TDI-carbon.htm">Remove the intake manifold.</a>&nbsp; If you
have a BEW pumpe duse engine, also see <a href="clean-intake-manifold-pd.htm">1000q:
BRM intake manifold removal</a>.&nbsp; The BEW engine intake manifold is
different but the exhaust manifold and turbo is similar to ALH engine and it
will give you a rough idea of what to do.&nbsp; It's not required to remove the EGR cooler - just remove
its 3x bolts and tie the cooler out of
the way.&nbsp; Also disconnect the VNT actuator's vacuum line from the N75
solenoid.&nbsp; I suggest removing it at the solenoid to avoid disturbing the
bottom end.</p>
<p>Spray all the exhaust manifold nuts with PB Blaster or liquid wrench
penetrating lubricant.&nbsp; Pictured below is the exhaust manifold removed so
you can picture where the exhaust manifold nuts are.&nbsp; Spray some on the 2x heat shield nuts.&nbsp;
Penetrating lubricant will help
eat rust, loosen
them, and really help prevent stripping.&nbsp; Also put a few drops on top of the oil line union.&nbsp; This will help
prevent twisting of the oil feed line when you remove it later.</p>
<p>The black ball stud on the intake manifold is the &quot;easy pop off&quot;
engine cover mod.&nbsp; It replaces the studs/nuts with a pop off connector.&nbsp; See <a href="engine-cover-pop-replace.htm">1000q: pop off engine cover</a>
to see more info.<br>

<p>Remove the turbo intake hardpipe (1x 10mm bolt on the intake manifold and 1x allen
head bolt holding the other bracket as detailed in the intake manifold removal
article).&nbsp; Remove the turbo outlet-intercooler piping.&nbsp; Use the remote operated
spring clamp pliers to release the spring clamps at the turbo and
intercooler.&nbsp; 1x 10mm nut holds the intercooler piping to the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>An ALH turbo is shown - to release the BEW engine hoses, pull the quick
connect clip out and the tabs that hold the hose will be released.<br>

<p>Remove the 3x 13mm downpipe nuts (yellow arrows).&nbsp; One may be hidden
from below but you should be able to see it from above.&nbsp; The red arrow
indicates the location of the oil union when viewed from below.<br>

<p>Here is another view of the downpipe after turbo removal.<br>
&nbsp;<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/headrem6a.jpg" width="709" height="503"></p>
<p>Remove the turbo bracket line (1x 16mm bolt) and oil line.&nbsp; If you have
a BEW engine the bracket is in a slightly different place.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/headrem7.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Here is another view - this oil return line is different because it sits
under the turbo bracket.&nbsp; If you have this style of oil return line, loosen it
as much as possible.&nbsp; After you start to pull off the exhaust manifold, you'll have enough clearance to loosen the return line all the way
to remove it.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/headrem7a.jpg" width="638" height="586"></p>
<p>Loosen but do not remove the oil feed line at the turbo by counterholding the
union while loosening its 17mm nut.&nbsp; Leaving it attached after loosening it will help keep the turbo oil union
clean while you remove the other exhaust manifold nuts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the service manual
says to replace the oil feed line each time, it's possible to reuse it if it's
clean and clear.&nbsp; If the insides have buildup or if it gets twisted <u>at
all</u> during removal, do not reuse the oil feed line.&nbsp; Do not try to
untwist it because once it's twisted at all, it's no longer usable.&nbsp; The
journal bearings in the turbo float on a layer of oil and you don't want to
restrict any oil pressure.<br>

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="1100">
  <tr>
    <td valign="top" width="500"> There isn't enough clearance for a normal
      wrench so Herm TDI found you can cut a notch in a 12 point head wrench (so
      it can go around the oil line, like a flare wrench, pics mirrored with
      permission).&nbsp; This method is the least likely to twist the oil
      line.&nbsp; eddie1 found that if your wrench is short enough it may
      fit.&nbsp; While you could use a 7mm allen wrench or square punch wedged
      between the oil union and turbo exhaust housing side to jam the oil union,
      it only holds 1 side and could strip the union.&nbsp; I suggest placing it
      on the cast iron exhaust side and not the aluminum side.&nbsp; A stubby
      wrench or a crow's foot wrench on an extension (shown right) can reach the
      upper 17mm oil line &quot;nut&quot;.
      <p>Again, if the oil line gets twisted it's no longer usable.&nbsp; Just
      cut it off for easy removal and cap the end so dirt doesn't fall into the
      turbo oil line.</p>
      <p>After the oil line is removed wad some plastic or a paper towel into
      the oil union to keep the insides clean.</td>

<p> Also remove the oil line banjo bolt at the oil filter (1x 17mm) and the 2
brackets holding the oil line (1x 10mm bolt on each bracket).&nbsp; If the oil
line is still good, just loosen the bolt, pivot the oil line out of the way, and
hand tighten it to hold the line.<br>

<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/turbor3b.jpg" width="709" height="560"></p>
<p>Remove the nut/stud holding the heat shield onto the exhaust manifold and
then remove the 8x 12mm exhaust manifold nuts.&nbsp; Note the spacer under each
nut.&nbsp; Once you are ready to remove the last manifold nut, remove/pivot the oil feed
line out of the way.&nbsp;
The turbo should now come off.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/turbor4.jpg" width="850" height="406"></p>
<p>Installation is the reverse of removal.&nbsp; Use some high temp antiseize on
the exhaust nuts. </p>
<p> When installing the oil line, snug up the union first but don't counterhold
it when tightening the oil line nut.&nbsp; Just tighten the nut and it will
tighten the union.&nbsp; You only have to counterhold the union when loosening
the oil line.&nbsp; This assumes that the union can move freely and isn't
rusted.&nbsp; Do not use any gasket maker on the unions.&nbsp; Gasket maker
will squeeze into the oil line and could block it.&nbsp; If you are reusing a
good oil line,
you could put a dab of gasket maker on the <u>outside only</u>  after final
assembly - never apply gasket maker to the inside. </p>
<p> Make sure to put some oil in the union and let it run through to help lubricate the turbo.&nbsp;
Crank the engine with no fuel to prime the turbo with oil.&nbsp; You can do this
by disconnecting the injection pump shut off solenoid wire (single wire with nut
on top of the injection pump).&nbsp; After engine start, let the engine idle for a minute to ensure lubrication to
the turbo. </p>
