<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows a comparison of skid plates and shows how to install one
on a VW Jetta TDI, other cars similar.</h2>
<p>The aluminum oil pan on the mk4 TDI is low to the ground and can be damaged by road hazards.&nbsp; Unlike
most cars, it
hangs below the front car subframe and is exposed under the car.&nbsp; Road
debris like tire treads (they are made with steel cords) or roadkill may
hit the oil pan instead of being somewhat blocked by the subframe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the oil pan is aluminum, if the car bottoms out in a
pothole or hits road debris and cracks the oil pan,  the
engine oil will leak out.&nbsp; If the crack is big enough for oil pressure to be lost, the
engine will quickly be damaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;Replacing the plastic lower
engine cover (splash shield) with a metal skid plate will help protect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stock plastic splash shield protects against dirt, small pebbles, and water only.&nbsp; This is important because it protects the drive belts at the
front of the engine and keeps road salt/some dirt out of the engine bay.&nbsp; It also dampens sound, reduces wind noise, and
improves aerodynamics. However it offers no protection against speed bumps, potholes, or
road
debris.&nbsp; If it's damaged you could find a used one but if
it gets torn off then it means you were very close to oil pan damage.&nbsp; A metal skid plate
usually costs less than a new stock
splash shield and provides some protection.&nbsp; It also helps stiffen the chassis which
can help handling.&nbsp; You could also install a steel bottomed oil pan or <a href="struts-replace-VW-Golf.htm"> refresh the suspension</a> 
to raise the ride height slightly.&nbsp; If you need new tires soon, taller
sidewall tires will raise the car but make handling slightly softer.&nbsp; See <a href="../tire-wheel-gearing-calculator.htm">1000q:
tire calculator</a> to see how much tires could affect ride height.</p>
<p> This article shows installation of a dieselgeek skid plate on a mk4 Jetta.&nbsp; Any tips
here are superceded by the manufacturer instructions and apply only to my car
and this exact model of skid plate.&nbsp; A few metal skid plate options are
listed below.&nbsp; I found the product and phone service from dieselgeek to be good enough to recommended but this page is not an endorsement or recommendation of any specific
skid plate.&nbsp; A basic comparison of the various skidplates is listed below.</p>
<p>The hazard is caused by a few reasons.&nbsp; As mentioned above, the oil pan is exposed and hangs below the
subframe.&nbsp; The TDI engine is heavier than
a gasoline engine - this extra weight causes the front of the car to sit lower.&nbsp;
While the springs are stiffer vs. a gas engine to account for this, age and mileage wears compresses springs and lowers ride height. The struts are tuned soft so when you hit a pothole or run over a
speed bump, the front end can move more, potentially striking the ground.&nbsp; New springs and bushings will raise ride height
in the front to new specs. Firmer struts will also help dampen movement and reduce bouncing of the car.&nbsp;
This reduces how fast the oil pan could
bottom out and also improves handling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The articles on this site avoid scaremonger language and try to keep
editorial to a minimum, so here's a story by &quot;alovelyman&quot; that made me laugh: &quot;I pulled into a gas station which is
used heavily by semi trucks.&nbsp; The entrance to this station has two small
impressions where the semi tires have compressed the roadway creating a little
bump in the road....Exiting my car I saw that some fool had left oil all over
the parking lot.&nbsp; It took me a few seconds but once I saw it lead right to
me I began the finest foul mouthed rant I've had in years.&quot;&nbsp; Total
cost for tow and repair: $1700.&nbsp; A skid plate is not required but it's a
cheap investment and provides a lot of confidence.</p>
<p>Note - a metal skid plate should not interfere with crash safety.&nbsp; In
the event of a severe frontal crash, the engine mounts will break away and the
engine should move under the car.&nbsp; The few bolts and anchors that hold the
skidplate aren't going to stop the heavy engine/transmission from moving where it wants
to go.&nbsp; I doubt that aluminum skidplates can withstand that amount of
force and VW's OEM skidplate is steel (stronger than aluminum) and is mounted at
the same points.</p>

<p><b>Optional</b>: steel bottomed oil pan VW# 1jm 198 601t from <a href="http://metalmanparts.com/product.sc?categoryId=-1&amp;productId=293">metalmanparts</a></p>
<p>A few of the available skid plates are OEM VW steel, Dieselgeek's aluminum
panzer, Defender-tech's galvanized steel, and
Evolution's aluminum atlas.&nbsp; These part numbers are for reference only,
double check with your vendor before ordering!&nbsp; If you have a New Beetle, I
suggest an aftermarket piece because the OEM skidplate for the New Beetle is
expensive (VW# 1c0 018 930a).</p>
<p><b>Dieselgeek's MK4
aluminum Panzer skidplate</b> (the <a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/MK4_Jetta_skid_plate_s/1835.htm" target="_blank">Jetta/Golf/New Beetle</a> skidplate is pictured below) uses two steel front posts and a bent tab at the rear to secure the skid plate. The steel front posts are a direct copy of the OEM posts (steel tubes angled forward with a two-bolt welded flange). 10mm bolts hold the skidplate to the two front mounting posts and three 10mm bolts secure the plate to the rear subframe mounting points&nbsp; I added some spray on liquid soundproofing to make it stealth and add sound dampening (optional).&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/Install_Guides.htm" target="_blank">Installation

<p><b>The OEM steel VW skidplate</b> is 1/3 heavier than aluminum and uses 2 thick front
  posts (2 bolts each).&nbsp; The disadvantage is that it's heavier and reduces ground
  clearance vs. the dieselgeek skidplate.&nbsp; In other words, it sits
  slightly lower
  to the ground than the other skid plates.&nbsp; It's also slightly harder to remove
  than the aftermarket skid plates because of the support arms on the sides.&nbsp; The advantage is that it's steel and
  its ribbed steel construction will hold up to heavy duty use.&nbsp; Then again, if your
  skidplate sees such heavy duty use that you can't use an  aluminum
  skidplate then you should be driving another vehicle with more ground
  clearance.&nbsp; Pictured below is an OEM steel skidplate from a R32 golf.<br>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Raise the front of the car securely.&nbsp; <a href="jackpoints.htm">Rest
the car on jack stands</a>, chock the rear wheels, and make sure the front of
the car is safe and stable before getting underneath.&nbsp; See the TOS
Agreement for the full legal disclaimer.&nbsp; Again, these exact tips are for the
<a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/servlet/Detail?no=358" target="_blank">dieselgeek skid plate</a> only.</p>
<p>Remove the plastic lower engine cover and side shields (t-25 torx screws and
speed washers)&nbsp; Wash the underside of the car - you'll be doing some work underneath the car
and it's nice to not be showered with dirt and rust.&nbsp; Always wear eye
protection.</p>
<p>Note - this installation method was of a 2009 model and earlier dieselgeek
skid plate which is also applicable to other models.&nbsp; For 2010 dieselgeek
changed the installation of rivnuts which is explained in the video below:<br>
<object width="640" height="385"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/Nn-RaQgPAOU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed src="http://www.youtube.com/v/Nn-RaQgPAOU&hl=en_US&fs=1&rel=0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true" width="640" height="385"></embed></object></p>
<p>Grease the <u> inside threads</u> of each rivnut <b>thoroughly</b> and set aside.&nbsp;
You may also see it called a rivinut, rivenut, rivetnut, or rivet nut.&nbsp; The purpose of
greasing them is to let the bolt threads slide and mushroom the rivnut as you tighten
each bolt.&nbsp; If you don't grease it the threads could strip so apply plenty
of grease to the bolt's threads!&nbsp;
Mushrooming inside the frame is how the rivnut holds the car.&nbsp; When
you install each rivnut, grease a bolt and washer, put them on one side of the
install tool and hand tighten the bolt into the rivnut.&nbsp; Avoid getting
grease on the outside of the rivnut as it installs easier with more friction
against the body.&nbsp; Make sure to
securely press the rivnut (or install tool) against the car so that it installs
flat.&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/skid2.jpg" width="514" height="245"></p>
<p>Here's a video showing more on rivnut installation on a mk4.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/IA7U-k1pu-Y?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>If the rivnut gets stripped, use a grinder to cut an &quot;X&quot; or star
in the rivnut head and then chisel the head away.&nbsp; You can then punch the rivnut
body into the subframe.&nbsp; You could also drill out the center and then punch
the rest out.&nbsp; A third option is to tap new threads.&nbsp; If you need more
rivnuts the part numbers are listed above.</p>
<p>Install 3 rivnuts in the front subframe at the circled holes below.&nbsp;
These will hold the rear of the skidplate.&nbsp; Use the installation tool to
hold the rivnut while you tighten it's bolt to 35 ft-lbs.&nbsp; Remove the bolt
and wipe clean.</p>
<p>Circled below are the 3 rear rivnuts after installation.<br>

<p>Passenger side:<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/skid6.jpg" width="850" height="507"></p>
<p>Install 2 rivnuts for the front posts in each frame rail.&nbsp; The install
tool has a cutout hole to go through the stud sticking out of the frame
rail.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/skid7.jpg" width="850" height="493"></p>
<p>If you don't have an install tool, use the front post as an install tool to
hold the rivnuts.&nbsp; You can now install the front posts.&nbsp; Each post
should slant towards the front of the car.&nbsp; Repeat for the other side.&nbsp;
Leave the 2 front post bolts loose during initial skid plate installation for
proper alignment of all the bolt holes.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/skid8.jpg" width="850" height="555"></p>
<p>Cut the plastic sideshields to clear the front posts.&nbsp; They will be
inboard of the front posts.&nbsp; Even if they are damaged, they can still be
used since they are not structural to the skidplate at all.&nbsp; Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for
exact dimensions.&nbsp; While they were off, I applied liquid soundproofing to
them to help quiet the engine.&nbsp; See <a href="../multi/soundproofing-car.htm">1000q:
soundproofing</a> for more tips.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/skid9.jpg" width="709" height="386"></p>
<p>Attach the plastic sideshields before attaching the skid plate.&nbsp;
Lubricate each front post's threaded hole with WD-40 and test thread a bolt to
throughly lubricate the threads.&nbsp; Now lift the skid
plate and attach 2-3 bolts to hold the skidplate from falling down.&nbsp; Put a
washer above the center rear hole.&nbsp; Loosely hand thread the 5x 17mm bolts,
make sure everything is aligned, and then tighten them all to 35 ft-lbs.&nbsp; I
prefer to tighten the driver's side rear bolt first since it's at a slight
angle.&nbsp; This should help prevent stripping of the rivnut.&nbsp; The skid
plate will slightly distort while you tighten the other bolts.&nbsp; To minimize
this angle and distortion, I placed a rubber washer between the skid plate at
the driver's side rear bolt.&nbsp; Remember to tighten the front post bolts now
that the skid plate is aligned.</p>
<p>The sideshields will only use 1 speed washer and 2 torx screws.&nbsp; The
front screw may be too short so just use the long phillips screw to hold the
front.</p>
