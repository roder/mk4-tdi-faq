<b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows how to change your manual transmission gear
oil on VW TDI Jetta.&nbsp; The change interval is as needed.</h2> If your shifting is getting more difficult, it could be due to low or
dirty gear oil.&nbsp; Your gear oil should be regularly changed.&nbsp; Note -
gas VW need a torx bit, VW diesel TDI use a regular 17mm allen for the drain and
fill plugs

shifter mechanism</a>.</p>
<h3>Parts</h3>
<p>17mm allen wrench<br>
catch pan<br>
gravity pump (siphon<b>)</b>, or compressed air tank, hose and nozzle, or some
other pump<br>
2.0 Liters of gear oil (the transmission and differential share the same oil)<br>
Basic kitty litter or driveway spill absorber<br>
paper towels</p>

  If your car is a late 99.5-2003, use 75w90 synthetic gear oil (VW#  g 005 000 is the .01 liter
    size) (VW#
    g 00500005 is the 0.5 liter size).<br>
If your car is a pumpe duse and is 2004-2005 you can use 2 types: (VW# g 060 726
a2 is the current synthetic oil (thanks for the tip heychris!), g 052 171 a2 is the
old synthetic
    oil) (VW# g052 726 a2 is the mineral oil).<br>
    If you have a choice, use the synthetic
    oil.&nbsp; For all cars, G70 supercedes all previous gear oils.
<p>VW is
      constantly changing their gear oil spec for whatever reason and contradicting
      themselves so just use whatever you want as long as it's GL-4.&nbsp; The part number for G70 is G
      070 726 a2.&nbsp; Most VW manual transmissions should only use a GL-4 gear oil, not a GL-5 gear oil like Mobil 1 75-90.&nbsp; Many people have success with Redline MTL or MT
      90, or Royal Purple Max gear.&nbsp; I have tried a few different gear
      oils including the OEM VW synthetic and found that I prefer Redline MTL since it's slightly thinner and
  makes shifting easier, especially in the winter.&nbsp; Here is a link where you can get <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/the-1634/MTL-70W80-GL-dsh-4-Gear/Detail" target="_blank">Redline MTL</a>.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Engage the parking brake, chock the wheels, <a href="jackpoints.htm"> jack up the car using the factory
jack points</a>, rest car securely on jack stands, and make sure the car is safe and
secure before doing anything else.&nbsp; Note that the car <b>must</b> be level,
otherwise the fluid level will not be accurate.&nbsp; I use wheel blocks to
raise the car as an extra level of
safety in addition to jack stands as suggested in <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
mechanics tips</a> or <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">1000q: making wood blocks</a>.</p>
<h4>Draining the fluid</h4>
<p>Engage the parking brake and put the car in gear, jack up the car using the factory jack points, rest
car securely on jack stands, chock the front and/or rear wheels as necessary,
and make sure the car is safe and secure before doing anything else.&nbsp; Remove
the&nbsp; plastic splash shield under the engine.&nbsp; If your car is lowered
or you want an extra level of protection for the aluminum oil pan you can add a
metal skid plate.&nbsp; See <a href="Skid-plate-install.htm">1000q: skid plate</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Clean the area around the fill and drain holes or else
dirt can get into the transmission fill hole.</p>
<p>Use 17mm allen wrench to loosen the fill hole plug, circled in yellow below.&nbsp; <b>Always
loosen or remove the fill hole
first</b> to make sure that you can refill the transmission after draining.</p>
<p>Loosen drain plug, circled in green.&nbsp; Put a catch pan under the drain
plug, remove the plug, and let drain.&nbsp;<br>

<p>Below is another picture from a different view on a mk3 VW.&nbsp; It's the
same basic transmission except the power steering line is routed differently.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a3b4/trans/transdrain.jpg" width="640" height="506"></p>

<h4>Refilling the manual transmission gear oil</h4>
<p>Clean the drain plug and put it back.&nbsp; Torque to about 20-23 ft lbs.</p>
<p>Refill with 2.1L.&nbsp; Once you have added enough gear oil, it should start
to drip out of the fill hole (assuming the car is level).&nbsp; Stop and put the cleaned fill plug back.&nbsp;
Torque the plug to about 20-23 ft lbs.&nbsp; If you
foamed the oil at all, add slightly more fluid to the transmission to compensate
for the foamed oil (the foamed oil contains air).</p>
<p>There are a few ways to get the fluid back in.&nbsp; You can use a gravity
pump or siphon, where the bottle is higher than the fill hole and connected with
a hose.&nbsp; You can also use a hand pump designed to force fluid out of a
container.&nbsp; The easiest method on the TDI is to use a funnel and hose, and snake it
into the transmission fill hole from above.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that this also
wastes the least fluid.&nbsp; Below is a picture of the yellow tube going into
the fill hole, sorry that it isn't that great but it's not terribly interesting
and if you got this far you know where the fill hole is.&nbsp; (*your car may
look different)<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a3b4/trans/transfill.jpg" width="517" height="480"></p>
<p>Another method is to use compressed air to force the fluid into the fill
hole.&nbsp; It's not possible to use a funnel on many cars so I originally made
this for my Audi and on other cars.&nbsp; To use the compressed air method of adding fluid, take a compressed air tank
and regulate the pressure down to a reasonable amount, just enough to get the
fluid flowing.&nbsp; If the pressure is way too high, the bottle could pop, so start low
and then increase the pressure if the fluid isn't moving fast enough.</p>
<p>Use a short length of hose, just longer than what is needed to go from the bottom
corner of the bottle to the transmission fill hole.&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the
hose has at least 1/4 diameter, otherwise the fluid will have a hard time
flowing through the hose.&nbsp; If you can't
breathe through the hose, it's too thin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poke a hole slightly smaller than the hose in the cap (smaller is better for
a tight air seal), and a small hole (again, smaller is better) in the top of the
bottle, marked by the green arrow in the below picture.&nbsp; Obviously the air
input hose has to be above the fluid level or else it will leak out.&nbsp; Now stick the hose
into the cap, making sure the hose goes all the way to the bottom.&nbsp; Make sure that the hose goes all the way to the bottom of the bottle
otherwise you will get just foam instead of fluid.&nbsp; Too much foam will fool you into thinking there is more fluid than
is actually in the transmission.&nbsp; If this happens, let it settle down and overfill it
slightly.&nbsp; Also make sure the hose has a large enough inside diameter
because thin hoses will transfer fluid at a snail's pace.&nbsp; Since a picture is
worth a thousand words, here you go.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/fluid%20pump.jpg" width="504" height="544"></p>
<p>Now press the compressed air nozzle into the hole in the top of the bottle
marked with the green arrow in the picture above.&nbsp; Warning!&nbsp; Do this
step last because you may accidentally press the trigger on the compressed air
nozzle before the hose is in the fill hole.&nbsp; If this happens, your
expensive fluid is now all over the ground.&nbsp; Apply gradually increasing
amounts of pressure until the fluid is gone.&nbsp; If the bottle stretches a
little that is okay.&nbsp; If you think it's going to pop, stop applying
pressure.&nbsp; I put my gloved hands around the bottle cap and nozzle to
prevent any fluid from hitting me in case the bottle cap blows off.&nbsp; As
always, wear protective safety goggles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like this tip?&nbsp; There are many more tips for the mechanic at <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
mechanics tips and garage organization</a>.</p>
<p>Note that the fill hole end of the hose has a coat
hanger bent into an s-shape (so it stays in place) with a hook at the end.&nbsp;
I did this so that I could use the same hose for both manual and automatic
transmissions and to minimize dripping at the end of the hose.&nbsp; Some Audi
transmissions have a cap on the fill hose which requires a 90<sup>o</sup> bend
at the tip.</p>
<p>Once the gear oil comes out of the drain hole (assuming the car is level) or
you have added enough gear oil, stop and put the cleaned fill plug back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you go to the next bottle, just poke
another air intake hole in the next bottle and transfer the cap.&nbsp; Don't let the hose touch the
ground because it will collect dirt.&nbsp; If it gets dirty just thoroughly wipe it
off.</p>
<p>When putting the fill and drain plugs back, you can wrap the threads once or
twice with teflon tape to help ensure no leaks.</p>
<p>After you're done, hang the hose with a paper towel or two on the end and let
it drip dry.</p>

<p>If you spilled some gear oil during this procedure, wipe it up with paper
towels.&nbsp; Then sprinkle kitty litter or driveway spill absorber and step on
it to grind it into the stain.&nbsp; After it sits and absorbs the oil, sweep up
the gravel/dust.&nbsp; Most local auto shops or garages will accept used engine
oil or gear oil for free but if you can't find a local disposal, <a href="http://earth911.com/">earth911.com</a>
can search for a local waste disposal.&nbsp; You can also use a large piece of
cardboard to act like a placemat to avoid small stains from leaks. </p>
