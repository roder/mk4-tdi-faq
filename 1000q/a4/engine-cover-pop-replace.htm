<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows how to modify the engine cover on your VW TDI to the OEM
pop off covers.</h2>
<p>The engine cover keeps the engine warm, clean, and quiet.&nbsp; It also
helps hold the oil dipstick in place, preventing it from shaking loose from
engine vibration.&nbsp; However, the 3x 10mm nuts that hold it on can't
be easily removed by hand.&nbsp; Later pumpe duse engine covers used ball-socket pop off connections to hold the engine cover
on which let you pull the engine cover off by hand.&nbsp; Pictured below are
the ball and socket together and separated.&nbsp; Retrofitting these onto your
engine cover makes removal much faster and easier.&nbsp; The ALH cover is shown
but this article should also apply to the 2004-2005 VW Passat TDI.<br>

<p>You could DIY a kit by using a bolt threaded into the stud location and using
a tight hose slipped over the bolt to hold the engine cover.&nbsp; Buying the
retrofit kit looks completely stock and makes a satisfying pop noise when it's
removed.&nbsp; You cannot put these onto the earlier mk3 engine covers because
the holes don't have enough material to hold the
socket.</p>
<h2>Parts</h2>
<p>3 each of 06a 103 951 (ball stud) and 06a 103 226 (socket/buffer) for ALH engine cover retrofit</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The retrofit sockets will not fit the BEW engine cover. If you need replacement pop covers for your BEW they are VW# 038 103 184 b. The BEW sockets are much wider and will cause the hole to be too big on your ALH engine cover.<br>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>Unscrew the engine cover studs and screw on the 14mm ball studs.</p>
<p>The new sockets are slightly larger than the old rubber buffer so you have to
enlarge the holes in the engine cover.&nbsp; The stock hole is about 19mm and you have to enlarge
them to about 27mm.&nbsp; Make the hole just big enough to &quot;twist and
thread&quot; the sockets into place from underneath.&nbsp; This way the sockets
are held tight.&nbsp; If you make the holes too large, the sockets may not hold
the engine cover tightly.</p>
<p>Here is a picture comparing a new socket in place, enlarged hole, and unmodified
hole.<br>
