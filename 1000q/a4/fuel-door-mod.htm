<h2>This mod lets you open the fuel filler door open further.&nbsp; It should
work on all VW TDI up to 2010-2011 when they changed to the &quot;press in and
release&quot; door.</h2>
<p>The VW mk4 fuel filler door only pops open 1cm when you press the
button to open the &quot;gas cap&quot; door.&nbsp; This makes it harder to open and could cause
fingernail scratches on the paint.&nbsp; Fingernail scratches are also common on
the cabin door handle, ashtray, or radio knobs.&nbsp; While <a href="vent-fuel-tank-FAQ.htm">removing the fuel vent</a> (only for
diesel cars, NOT for gas cars, do not attempt to remove the fuel vent on a gas
car!) I modified the spring so that the door pops open 2-3 inches.</p>
<p>There are 2 springs on the door.&nbsp; Under the solenoid shaft (when you
press the fuel door release button this retracts) there's a spring that pushes
the door open.&nbsp; The other spring holds the door full open but creates
resistance to opening the door even a little.&nbsp; By bending the &quot;push open&quot;
spring to increase its force and the &quot;hold open&quot; spring to reduce its force, the door opens much more
when you press the button but still holds in the full open position when you
open it all the way.&nbsp; If you don't care that the door snaps to the full open position
then remove the &quot;hold open&quot; spring and see how you like it.</p>
<h3>Procedure to mod the door</h3>
<p>Remove the fuel filler door assembly, 1x T20 torx screw.&nbsp; Put a clean
paper towel in the filler neck so that dirt on the back of the assembly doesn't
fall into the fuel tank.&nbsp; Then pivot the black assembly out and to the right
- then
pull it a little to the left to clear the right side hinge.&nbsp; This will let
you remove the fuel door assembly from the car.<br>

<p>Remove the latch strike to increase the force of the &quot;push
open&quot; spring by bending it out.&nbsp; Use a thin pry and push the spring in
before pulling it out to release the middle piece of the spring.<br>

<p>The &quot;hold open&quot; spring is behind the hinge of the filler door
assembly.&nbsp; Remove the door by prying the plastic door pivot out.&nbsp;
Don't try to pry the spring out first because you might break the plastic
door.&nbsp; The spring is shaped like a S.&nbsp; If you hold it to the side it looks like a
N or 2!&nbsp; If you don't care that the door stays full open then remove the
spring, reassemble, and see how you like it.<br>

<p>If you want the door to stay open, flatten the spring to reduce its force and replace.&nbsp; Use
a screwdriver to push it onto the rib perches during installation.&nbsp;
However, the &quot;hold open&quot; spring still prevented the filler door from
opening much so I flattened it more.&nbsp; Unfortunately, not enough pressure caused it to pop
off its perch and not function.&nbsp; To solve this, I used a dremel to cut a
groove in the 3 ribs that are the spring's perch.&nbsp; Without the grooves, the
spring would click and pop off the perch when the door was closed.&nbsp; With
the grooves, the spring was held securely.</p>
<p> Also
make sure that the spring is bent so that it makes contact with all 3 rib spring
perches.&nbsp; If it's at an angle the spring isn't seated on all the perches
and it encourages the spring to pop off.<br>

<p>A dremel cutting disk with an extension through the latch hole of the assembly cut
the grooves at the correct angle.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<p>Here is a side view.&nbsp; By cutting a groove in the rib, it holds the
spring and prevents it from popping out because of less spring pressure.<br>

<p>Final result - much easier to open the door! </p>
