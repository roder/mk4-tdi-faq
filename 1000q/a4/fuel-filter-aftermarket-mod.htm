<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h2>This article shows how to modify the fuel filter system on your VW Jetta TDI, VW
Golf TDI, or Beetle TDI, 1998-2006 to use a 2 micron filter.</h2>
<p>For how to change the OEM fuel filter, see <a href="fuel-filter-change-TDI-engine.htm">1000q: mk4 fuel filter replacement DIY</a>.</p>
<p>The OEM fuel filter filters to 10 microns and has a thermostatic T to recirculate warmed fuel from the engine back to the filter in cold temperatures. This mod is by Richard55 and uses the NAPA 4770 fuel filter housing and a 2 micron Cat filter. It eliminates the fuel T so it's not suggested to do this mod anywhere cold.</p>

<h3>Fuel filter DIY Mod</h3>
<p>This first image shows the adaptor and where to start cutting, with a hack saw, for get rid of the three hole mount, again we don't need it, so lets get rid of the excess baggage.<br>

<p>After cutting the mounting portion off, I ground off the excess to make it better looking lol.<br>

<p>I used my belt sander to do the trimming as it was fast, the sander has an 80 grit belt on it and it went fast. I mounted the sander upside down in my vise and just went at it. Please be careful.<img src="../../images/a4/2micron-4.jpg" alt="tdi fuel filter mod" width="529" height="500"></p>
<p>Look at both sides of the adaptor before you cut. A $22.00 mistake.<br>

<p>Here is the final shot before painting the adaptor. It is mounted with the Cat filter, using the stock mount. The mount is modified by taking the tightening screw part out and using my airplane saftey wire pliers with saftey wire to hold the filter in place. This is a 2 micron filter and is way better then the 15-20 micron stock filter and is only about 8 dollars. <br>

<p> The motor mount is out so you can see the bracket better. <br>

<p>Replace all the clamps and check for any loose tools, paper towels, etc.&nbsp; Take a test drive and check for any leaks.<br>
