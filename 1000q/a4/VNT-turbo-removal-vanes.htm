<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2><b>This article shows how to disassemble the VNT mechanism for cleaning on a
VW Jetta TDI.</b></h2>
<p>Note - turbo housing removal and VNT disassembly requires at least basic
mechanical experience and tools.&nbsp; You are not disassembling the turbo CHRA
so you don't need to index the wheels or balance them.&nbsp; Basic definitions:
CHRA - center housing rotating assembly - this part holds the oil fittings,
bearings, and
turbo wheels.&nbsp; Turbine/intake side is the
aluminum side.&nbsp; Compressor/exhaust side is the cast iron side.&nbsp; For
more details on how a turbo works and parts, see <a href="../turbocharging.htm">1000q:
turbocharging FAQ</a>.</p>

The Bentley service manual is about $80 and doesn't have this procedure. This free website has videos,  color pictures, and has saved many people from much more expensive repairs.. Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>The VNT lever on the outside is welded to a lever inside the turbo housing.&nbsp;
This lever rotates the ring inside the turbo and moves the VNT vanes.&nbsp; See the below videos to see how
smooth and free the lever should move.&nbsp; It should not stick or bind at
all.&nbsp; Vacuum is being applied to the can, not pressure.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/QdqMmB3hxTM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>Here is how the lever and ring move the vanes.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu0UGKS7-JQ?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>Sometimes the lever can wear down into the ring and cause it to get stuck or
not respond correctly.<br>

<p>In these pictures you can see the extra play between the lever and the
ring.&nbsp; The ring repair procedure is shown below.<br>

<h3>Innotec turbo cleaning kit or Easy Off oven cleaner method to clean a stuck TDI turbo</h3>
<p>In some cases, oven cleaner or the innotec turbo cleaning kit will successfully free the turbo vanes. While it could be applied to the exhaust side on a cold and non-running turbo, it's  better to remove the turbo from the car to ensure that all of the cleaner is removed (rinse with water), clear the oil lines of any cleaner that got into the bearings, and inspect operation of the turbo afterwards. Sodum Hydroxide (Lye) is the active ingredient in oven cleaners - refer to your product's MSDS for safey precautions. Lye pits and stains aluminum so only use the cleaner on the exhaust side to free up the vanes. You don't want to get any of it on your skin or have it splashing around while you work underneath the car. NaOH (Lye) contact can cause  chemical burns to exposed skin or blindness if it gets in your eyes. See the TOS Agreement for the full legal disclaimer. If it gets on you, rinse with water and contact a medical professional.</p>
<h3>Removal Procedure
</h3>
<p><a href="turbo-removal-TDI-engine.htm">Remove the turbo</a> and cover the oil feed and drain lines.&nbsp; I also suggest
covering the compressor side openings with tape and cleaning the exterior of the
turbo.
</p>
<p>Remove the actuator (2x 10mm) bolts and remove the circlip holding the VNT
lever to actuator rod.&nbsp; I suggest getting a spare clip since these can fly
off during installation.<br>

<p>The turbo housing will be rusted to the CHRA so soak the exterior of the turbine
side in PB Blaster or liquid wrench.&nbsp; Tilt the turbo and fill the inside of the turbine side
with PB Blaster too.&nbsp; This will penetrate the joint from the inside and
preclean/loosen a lot of the soot buildup inside.&nbsp; Let it soak for a while
and tap it to help the lubricant penetrate.&nbsp; If it's really stuck then let it soak overnight.</p>
<p>Once it's soaked and penetrated, you may notice that the VNT lever may move
freely.&nbsp; Don't be fooled into thinking &quot;problem solved&quot; because the
ring inside sticks and it's range of movement won't clean the area where it
sticks - you'll still need to
disassemble the turbo to clean it.&nbsp; Remove the 5x 10mm bolts holding the
housing to the CHRA.&nbsp; The two bolts without washers hold the actuator
bracket.</p>
<p>Now separate the turbine housing/exhaust manifold from the CHRA.&nbsp; The
joint is highlighted with a dash red line below....</p>
