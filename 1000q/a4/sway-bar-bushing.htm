<h2>This article shows sway bar bushing replacement.&nbsp; The second half shows
sway bar endlink replacement.&nbsp; Unlike most suspension changes you don't
need an alignment after changing these.</h2>
<p>The sway bar (sometimes called anti roll bar) connects the left and right
suspension to the front subframe.&nbsp; There are bushings on the middle and
ends (end links).&nbsp; Your VW TDI only has a sway bar in the front, there is
no sway bar in the rear because it's a torsion beam suspension.&nbsp; A sway bar
reduces car lean during cornering by effectively connecting the left and right
springs/suspension.&nbsp; Unbalancing the front and rear lean will change how
the car understeers or oversteers.&nbsp; Some understeer is desirable to
maintain stability.</p>
<p>The procedure is the
same for all mk4 a4 body cars.&nbsp; The sway bar is connected to the lower control
arms by the endlinks and resists body tilting during turns.&nbsp; VW/Audi sway bar bushings tend
to get worn out fairly quickly.&nbsp; The endlinks last much longer.&nbsp; Symptoms of a bad sway bar bushing include
a deep/hollow clunking noise in the front when you hit shallow holes or
bumps.&nbsp; Check for play in the sway bar bushings since the bushing's hole
gets enlarged with wear.&nbsp; Below is the bracket and a new and old bushing.<br>

<p>I prefer &quot;rubber&quot; sway bar bushings.&nbsp; Poly or urethane sway bar bushings
are generally harder and last longer but may squeak and make noise.</p>
<h4>Different bushings and brackets over the years</h4>
<p>Early TDI may have used 19mm diameter sway bars.&nbsp; Later used 21mm sway
bars.&nbsp; Still others used 23mm sway bars.&nbsp; There's no way to tell if
you have a 21 or 23mm sway bar so the only way to check is to get out a caliper
and check.&nbsp; Early TDI had a different bushing bracket, if you have the
early bracket without the rib down the middle, also get a replacement bracket to
match your replacement bushing.</p>
<h4>Sway bar endlink info</h4>
<p>There were 3 types of sway bar endlinks: metal, plastic with 16mm bolt, and
plastic with attached allen bolt.&nbsp; Although the metal one is slightly
different from the plastic, they are interchangeable as long as you replace them
as a pair.&nbsp; There are aftermarket thicker and
adjustable endlinks available but you'd be better off with thicker sway bars and
other suspension modifications first.</p>

<h3>Parts for sway bar bushing replacement</h3>
<p>2 sway bar bushings, one each side - make sure to check which diameter sway
bar you have!&nbsp; There is no way to check by the VIN, you have to measure it.&nbsp;
There is also some confusion on the part numbers, the part number ending in
&quot;T&quot; appears to be 23mm but comes up as 21mm on some websites.<br>

<h3>Procedure&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Raise the front end of the car, chock the rear wheels, remove the front
wheels, <a href="jackpoints.htm"> rest the car on jack stands</a>, and make sure the car is safe and secure
before getting underneath at all, see the TOS Agreement for the legal
disclaimer.</p>
<p>Once the car is securely raised on jack stands, shake the car a bit to make
sure it's secure.&nbsp; Use a piece of wood to protect the lower control arm and
jack it up slightly so that the lower bolt isn't under tension.&nbsp; Don't
raise it too far or else the car can lift off the jack stands!&nbsp; This is not
a safe condition since the car isn't stable unless it's weight is on the jack
stands at the factory jack points!</p>
<p>Disconnect the sway bar link from the lower control arm (1x 16 or 17mm, yellow
text).&nbsp; Either the upper or lower bolt will work, you just want to loosen
the sway bar.&nbsp; Either way, you
want to loosen the sway bar.&nbsp; Ignore the white text, that's for another
writeup.<br>

<p>Remove the 13mm bolt at the top of the sway bar bushing bracket.&nbsp; An
offset wrench or universal joint with an extension works great.&nbsp; As
pictured above, the bracket has a hook at the bottom so I suggest prying it out
to remove it.&nbsp; The bushing is split so
you can remove it without sliding it all the way off the end. <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/sway1.jpg" width="808" height="739"></p>
<p>Clean the dirt off the sway bar bushing's location and put a dab of silicone grease on the bar.&nbsp;
Caution: do not use lithium or moly grease since these are petroleum based and
can degrade rubber bushings!&nbsp; If you can't find silicone grease then just
install it dry.</p>
<p>Install the new bushing - note the rib down the middle of the bushing.&nbsp;
How it matches the
bracket's rib will show you which side of the bushing is up.</p>
<p>Since the bushing is new you may have to clamp the bracket down to get the
bolt back in.&nbsp;Torque on the 13mm bolt is 18 ft-lbs. <br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/sway4.JPG" width="594" height="403"></p>
<p>To replace the sway bar endlinks, remove the other 16mm bolt and the sway bar
is removed.&nbsp; Installation is the reverse of removal.&nbsp; Torque the
sway bar endlink bolts to&nbsp; 11 ft-lbs.&nbsp; Since this is very light and
the bolts/holes may be rusty, clean the threads and then apply medium strength
thread locker.&nbsp; The twisting motion of the sway bar could loosen the bolts.</p>
<p>Unlike most suspension changes you don't need an alignment after changing
these.</p>
