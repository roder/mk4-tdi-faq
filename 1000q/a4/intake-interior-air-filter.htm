<h2>This article is divided into three sections: replacing the intake air filter,
cleaning the snowscreen, and replacing the cabin air filter on a VW Jetta TDI</h2>
<p> The
snowscreen is an air intake snorkel with a screen that keeps out large
debris and snow out of the air intake box.&nbsp; If it gets clogged with mouse
nests or leaves, a spring
loaded auxiliary intake flap opens, preventing the engine from air
starvation. If the aux flap spring is rusted or the door is stuck, the engine will be air restricted.&nbsp; This aux air is somewhat warmed by the engine  and is
not as good as cold intake air but if it's working it prevents the engine from stalling.</p>
<p>Mann makes the OEM VW air filter so it's a good filter.&nbsp; The cold
climate air filter has an extra foam layer on the bottom.</p>
<p>The replacement interval is 40,000 miles. Change the cabin air filter as needed, once a year is suggested.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<h4>Intake air filter replacement </h4>
<p>All you have to do is unscrew the top cover to the air box.  (2 phillips screws).&nbsp; Mine were rusty so I used a dremel to cut a groove in
them and then used a standard screwdriver to remove the screws. </p>
<p>If you need more clearance, remove the MAF electrical plug and unclamp the accordion
  like hose if you want.&nbsp;
  I also suggest vacuuming out the bottom of the air filter box and cleaning the
  snowscreen while you are in there.&nbsp; Make sure the tabs all fit into their
slots and that the air filter edge gasket is seated properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>These cars are known for slow MAF failure.&nbsp; If your car has been losing
power, a faulty MAF may be responsible, see <a href="../multi/limp-mode-TDI-fix.htm">1000q:
limp mode</a>, <a href="../multi/low-power-fix-TDI.htm">1000q: constant low power or
can't rev</a>, and <a href="MAF-sensor-testing-VW-cleaner.htm">1000q: a4 MAF</a> for more details.&nbsp; If you determine that the MAF is bad and
need to remove the element, a special VW tool is required to
remove the MAF screws.&nbsp; You could also use the dremel to cut a groove into
it and just replace them with normal screws.&nbsp; Most MAF come as a whole unit
with the plastic and require no special tools to remove.<br>

<p>Very easy but here's a video anyways.&nbsp; There's unnecessary music in the
video so don't bother turning up the volume.<br>

<h4>Cleaning the snowscreen</h4>
<p>Note that in the below pictures, the air box and battery were removed for
clarity.</p>
<p>Remove (1x 10mm) nut circled in yellow and pull out the intake snorkel.&nbsp;
The snowscreen is at the end of the snorkel.&nbsp; Use water or compressed air to clean it
out and then replace it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not recommend cutting the snowscreen
out since it prevents larger debris from reaching the air filter.<br>

<h4>Cabin air filter replacement</h4>
<p>Remove the 4 phillips screws (one is circled in red) and pull up and away the
rubber weather stripping on top of the firewall.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/cabinair1.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Pull out the plastic trim and the cabin air filter.&nbsp; During reassembly, the black plastic frame has 2 tabs on the top front
edge and 3 tabs on the
lower rear edge.&nbsp; 1 of the tabs is marked in red.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/cabinair2.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>Vacuum out any dust/dirt and replace the filter and
trim.&nbsp; The ribbed cylindrical object below the air filter is the blower fan. If a leaf gets caught in there it'll rattle.<br>

<p>I prefer activated carbon filters since the activated carbon absorbs  odors.</p>
