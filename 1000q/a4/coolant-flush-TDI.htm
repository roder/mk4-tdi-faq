<h2>This article shows how to flush the engine coolant in your VW Jetta TDI, VW
Golf TDI, or Beetle TDI, 1998-2006</h2>
<p>For the mk5 Jetta TDI (2005-2006), see <a href="../a5/coolant-flush-mk5-Jetta.htm">1000q:
mk5 coolant flush</a>.</p>
<p>Engine coolant is the same as engine antifreeze.&nbsp; Although VW says it's
a &quot;lifetime&quot; fill, a reasonable suggested change interval is about 100,000 miles or as
needed, depending on use.&nbsp; Since some coolant is lost during a water pump
change, you'll end up draining a lot of it every 60,000 or 120,000 miles
with the timing belt service.&nbsp; Remove the lower radiator hose too and
what's replaced will be enough to keep the coolant in good condition.&nbsp; Many high mileage
cars show clean coolant passages with G12 even after 200,000+ miles!&nbsp; Your
coolant should be pink or light purple in color.&nbsp; While you are here, also
check for <a href="../multi/coolant-migration-VW-Audi.htm">coolant migration</a>.</p>
<p>Warning: do not mix red, pink, or
purple VW G12 coolant with green
or blue
coolant or other non-VW/Audi OEM or OEM compatible coolant!&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 3 main
types of coolant available: G12, G12+, and G12++.&nbsp; G12 (VW# g012-a8f-a4) is
compatible with G12+ (VW# g012-a8f-m1).&nbsp; The
replacement for G12+ is G12++ (VW# g012-a8g<b>-</b>m1).&nbsp; Pentosin is generic
OEM compatible coolant compatible
with G12.&nbsp; Just tell your vendor that you need G12 coolant because they are
all compatible.</p>
<p> If your coolant is brown,
a few things are possible.&nbsp; You could have a leak in the EGR cooler,
oil cooler, or head gasket.&nbsp; If it looks sooty then it could be residue
from an oil fill or the EGR cooler.&nbsp; If it's the EGR cooler then you should
also see coolant residue in the exhaust and see the coolant level
dropping.&nbsp; If it's the oil cooler then the oil and coolant are
mixing.&nbsp; You will see milky engine oil.&nbsp; Do not drive the car in this
condition, immediately change the oil and have oil and coolant flushed.&nbsp; If
it's the head gasket you will notice harder starting, burning coolant, and low
compression.&nbsp; You should also notice immediate pressurization of the
coolant reservoir on a cold engine.&nbsp; (Pressurization of the reservoir on a
warm engine is correct).&nbsp; It's also possible that there's a tiny leak
between the oil and coolant head gasket passage and not the cylinder, which will
not effect compression.&nbsp; Another possibility is that someone mixed
incompatible coolants together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the oil is contaminated, have it fixed immediately since contaminated oil
can cause engine damage.&nbsp; If you only have minor coolant contamination
don't worry about driving the car because what's done is already done and
nothing will immediately blow up.&nbsp; If you see scales or gummy buildup on
the inside of the coolant tank then do not drive - have the system flushed as
soon as possible since the contamination could lead to overheating and engine
damage.&nbsp; Contaminated coolant might not look dark if you take a small
sample but if it isn't pink/ purple/red through the coolant reservoir plastic,
then it's probably brown.&nbsp; Pictured below is contaminated coolant.</p>
<p>Also note that you should never use radiator stop leak products.&nbsp;
Although the TDI turbo is oil cooled only, as good practice, stop leak products
can gum up the turbo coolant lines and possibly cause damage to the turbo
and engine.<br>

<p>Never dispose of used engine antifreeze - coolant onto
the ground or into the water!&nbsp; If you can't find a dump, <a href="http://earth911.com/">earth911.com</a>
can search for a local waste disposal.</p>
<h3>Parts</h3>
<p>Coolant capacity: 6.0 Liters of coolant/distilled water<br>
Ratio: anywhere between 60% coolant/40% distilled water and 50% coolant/50 distilled water, higher coolant ratio provides better freezing protection<br>
Coolant type: VW G-012-A8F-M1 (ZVW 237 G12) or Pentosin G12 (pink color) <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-401/G12-Plus-Plus-Coolant/Detail" target="_blank">available from kermatdi 1.5L size</a><a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-401/G12-Plus-Plus-Coolant/Detail" target="_blank"></a><br>
<b>and/or (pink and purple coolant are compatible)</b> VW G-012-A8F-A4 or
Pentosin g12+ (G12 plus, purple color)</p>
<p>Enough concentrated coolant and distilled water to satisfy the required 6 liters.&nbsp;
Make sure to get a little extra to account for any spills.</p>
<p>Warning: coolant is poison.&nbsp; Wear waterproof gloves, and take all
precautions to avoid skin or eye contact.&nbsp; If some spills on your driveway,
rinse it off with water because animals may drink the coolant and become
poisoned.&nbsp; If you pollute, at least dilute.&nbsp; Also note all warnings and precautions on the coolant and in the
factory service manual.</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<h4>Draining the coolant</h4>
If the hose clamps for the hoses you want to remove are in the right spot, just
securely park the car.&nbsp; If the hose clamps are in odd locations that
require you to get under the car, engage the parking brake, jack up the front of the car using the factory jack
points, rest car securely on jack stands, chock the rear wheels, and make sure
the car is safe and secure before doing anything else.&nbsp; Remove engine top plastic cover.&nbsp;<p>Since
some model years are slightly different, you can modify this to suit your
car.&nbsp; The idea is that you want to open a low spot to let the coolant out
and refill it as necessary.&nbsp; If your fluid is still pink and clean, you can
just open the lower radiator hose and the oil cooler hose and refill as necessary.&nbsp; If your fluid
is dirty and contaminated or you want to switch from pink to green coolant or vice
versa, see the below section on <b>thoroughly flushing the coolant system.</b></p>
<p>If your radiator doesn't have a drain valve, remove the lower radiator hose
to drain the radiator.</p>
<p>Open the coolant reservoir cover (pictured below).&nbsp; This is a good time to check for coolant migration, a rare but very serious
condition effecting the wiring harness.&nbsp; See <a href="../multi/coolant-migration-VW-Audi.htm">1000q:
coolant migration</a> for more details.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/coolantflush3.jpg" width="640" height="414"></p>
Attach a drain hose to the radiator drain.&nbsp;
Open the valve or remove the lower radiator hose to drain the radiator.&nbsp; The drain is plastic so be careful.&nbsp;
You can apply low pressure air to the overflow
coolant tank to get additional fluid
    out.&nbsp; This drains coolant out of the radiator and coolant overflow tank.&nbsp;
The below picture is looking behind the driver's side bumper.<br>

<p>
To drain the coolant out of the engine block, remove
the oil cooler hoses outlined in green below.&nbsp; These hoses are accessible from the top
and are low enough to let most of the coolant drain out.&nbsp; To remove hoses, don't yank on the hose or pry with a
screwdriver.&nbsp; Try using pliers to twist the hose and break the seal first,
then it will pull off much easier.&nbsp; If you need to thoroughly flush the system, see the section below.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/coolantflush1.jpg" width="771" height="549"></p>
<h4>Thoroughly flushing the coolant system due to contamination</h4>
If you want a through flush, leave the lower hoses open and
apply low pressure compressed air to the coolant reservoir hoses to push the
coolant
    out.&nbsp; Use your finger to block the other end of the hose to effectively
push air out the open hose.&nbsp;
There will always be corners where there is lingering coolant but as long as the
coolant is not contaminated, don't worry about a little old coolant.&nbsp; Just
drain and refill.&nbsp; Skip the paragraphs below and go to <b>To refill coolant</b>.
<p>If your coolant is contaminated you need to flush a few times with first
water, then radiator flush/water, then distilled water to circulate the cleaner thoroughly.&nbsp;
Also drive the car with the water/cleaner mix to open the thermostat and
circulate the cleaners.&nbsp; If it's really bad, accept that you'll have to do
a flush again when you have time or take it to a professional.&nbsp; They have access to better radiator
flush machines and chemicals, it's easy for them to dispose of the used fluids,
and it's relatively inexpensive.&nbsp;
Just make sure you give them G12 coolant/water and make sure they do not to use
anything else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>First press
a garden hose against the removed oil cooler hose and it will backflush most of
the old coolant out.&nbsp; Remember, first twist the hoses at the flange to
break the seal first.&nbsp; This will let you pull it off much easier.&nbsp;
Remove the hose at the coolant reservoir and flush at the hose
there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also remove one of the heater core hoses on the firewall
and push the garden hose against the openings to flush out the heater core.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also remove the coolant flange on the driver's side cylinder head and flush
there.&nbsp; There
will still be some old coolant lingering in the system so repeat a few times and
then on the last flush, use distilled water.&nbsp; If you need to clean oil out,
try radiator flush cleaners.&nbsp; Do not use dishwashing soap or regular simple
green cleaner because these will foam or corrode aluminum.</p>

<h3>To refill the engine coolant:</h3>
<p>For a normal refill, first mix coolant with only distilled water.&nbsp; Tap
water contains minerals that will collect on the cooling system, damaging the
metal and reducing coolant efficiency. Also note that you cannot mix generic
green, orange, or blue coolant with G12 VW coolant!&nbsp; It will turn brown and
sludge.&nbsp; Make sure you mix the coolant in a ratio of between 40-50% water
and the rest of the solution coolant.</p>
<p>Put back and secure any hoses or drains that you loosened earlier.&nbsp; As
you add coolant/water to the coolant reservoir, air will slowly come out of the
bleed hose that connects to the reservoir at the top of the tank.&nbsp; During
this stage, the engine should not be running.&nbsp; Why not just add coolant into the reservoir on an empty coolant system,
start the engine, and let it pump itself to gradually bleed out the
air?&nbsp; Because that would take longer and the water pump would be starting
on a dry system.&nbsp; During start, it would not be lubricated by the coolant
and it would also cause lots of air bubbles and cavitation, causing you to
misjudge the coolant level and eroding the pump.&nbsp; Believe it or not, air
bubbles at the water pump can erode the water pump and cause excess vibration
over time, so maintaining proper level of coolant prevents water pump failure,
amongst other nasty problems.
<p>Once it is full, start the engine, and it should purge out any remaining air.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Leaving the heater on hot won't get the coolant out of the heater core since
it's always running through.&nbsp; Make sure any hoses or drains that you
loosened earlier are secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> Unclamp the hose
outlined in green in the picture below and pull that end back.&nbsp; I suggest using this hose because it's
small and easy to remove, and it's at a high point of the radiator and
engine.&nbsp; You can use any high spot, I just use this hose because it's very easy
to reach and it's high in the coolant circuit.&nbsp; As you add coolant/water to the coolant reservoir, air will slowly
come out this hose until the liquid reaches that level.&nbsp; Obviously, when
liquid starts coming out of the hose, reattach and re-clamp the hose.&nbsp;
During this stage, the engine should not be running!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> If you're in a rush
you can remove the hose closer to you, the upper radiator hose, and fill the
radiator with a funnel until it's almost full, then use the smaller hose to get more
air out.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/coolantflush2.jpg" width="896" height="485">
</p>
<p>Recheck that the radiator drain and all clamps have been retightened.&nbsp;
Check the coolant level.</p>
<p>Test drive to normal operating temperature and check the coolant level again.&nbsp;
If it didn't go down, you got all the air out.&nbsp; If the level went down,
wait until the car is cool and then add coolant/water until the level is between
mix/max.&nbsp; If you open the reservoir while the coolant system is hot,
scalding coolant could spray out so be very careful opening the
coolant system while it's hot and pressurized!</p>
<p>Check for any leaks and check the level after a longer normal drive.&nbsp; If
