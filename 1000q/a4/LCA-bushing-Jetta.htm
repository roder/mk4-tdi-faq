<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<h2>This article shows how to remove the lower control arm (LCA) and replace the
bushings on a VW Jetta TDI, VW Golf TDI, or New Beetle TDI.</h2>
<p>If you are doing a basic suspension overhaul, a new rear bushing
on the lower control arm is highly suggested since it wears out fairly
fast.&nbsp; If you examine the pictures below, the rear LCA bushing has big
spaces in it to allow movement.&nbsp; I suggest using the Audi TT rear LCA bushing
as a replacement since it will firm up handling without taking away comfort.&nbsp; The bushing is a direct fit on all mk3 and mk4 TDI passenger
cars.&nbsp; The front bushing on the lower control arm does not wear out as fast
since it's a solid rubber bushing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The ball joint can be replaced without removing the lower control arm but I would remove the
  driveaxle and the 3x 13mm bolts holding the ball joint.</p>
<p>Your car will need an alignment after bushing replacement.&nbsp; Drive around for a
day or two to let the suspension settle in.</p>
<p>Caution: Always tighten all suspension
components in their normal resting position (not extended or fully
compressed)!&nbsp; Install suspension bolts hand tight, rest the car on ramps,
then tighten the bolts to their final torque.&nbsp; This prevents the bushings
from being preloaded and wearing out prematurely.</p>

<h3>Control arm bushing replacement procedure</h3>
<p>CAUTION - do not rest the weight of the car on the suspension or rear axle.&nbsp;
These are not stable and can act like a fulcrum or move and cause the car to
move and fall down.&nbsp; You
need the suspension to be able to move while you work on it.&nbsp; Always use the factory jack points as specified in the service
manual.&nbsp; Then chock the wheels, apply the parking brake, and make sure the
car is safe and secure before working on it!&nbsp; Never get under the car while
it's supported by hydraulic jacks since these can fail - these are for raising
the car only.&nbsp; This article is not a substitute for the factory service
manual or the services of a professional mechanic.&nbsp; See the TOS Agreement
for the full legal disclaimer.</p>
<p>Safely raise and rest the car on jack stands and chock the rear wheels and
apply the parking brake.&nbsp; See <a href="jackpoints.htm">1000q: jack
stand mk4 Jetta</a> to see where I placed the jack stands.&nbsp; Take off the front wheels.&nbsp; Put a few drops of PB Blaster
around the bolts/nuts listed in this procedure and let soak.&nbsp; This will
make it much easier to remove them.</p>
<p>Remove the lower 16mm bolt (yellow below) to disconnect the sway bar endlink.&nbsp;
The sway bar bushings tend to wear out quickly, while you're in there you may
want to replace them.&nbsp; See <a href="sway-bar-bushing.htm">1000q: sway bar
bushing</a> for more details.&nbsp; Remove the LCA's 18mm bolt and 18mm bolt/nut.&nbsp;
Also remove the 3x 13mm ball joint nuts.&nbsp; All these bolts/nuts are one use
only, replace them with new after removal.<br>

<p>As outlined in green, an offset 18mm wrench can counterhold the 18mm nut on the rear of the LCA while you loosen its
bolt.&nbsp;  I know I'm not using an impact wrench socket but it's a
craftsman w/lifetime warranty and have another car to drive to Sears to get a replacement if it breaks.&nbsp; Don't do what I did - if
you use an impact wrench, use an impact wrench rated socket.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/lca2.jpg" width="720" height="590"></p>
<p>Here is the LCA with the TDI rear bushing.&nbsp; If you are using a stock
rear bushing instead of the Audi TT bushing, note the orientation of the spaces
in the bushing.&nbsp; If you are using an Audi TT bushing, there is no up/down,
left/right of the bushing.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/tdi-controlarm.jpg" width="630" height="533"></p>
<p>Here is the LCA with new bushings.&nbsp; The rear bushing is the solid Audi
TT bushing.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/lca3.jpg" width="630" height="558"></p>
<p>There is a shoulder on the LCA so you can only push the bushing out in one
direction.&nbsp; Again, if you are using a stock rear bushing instead of the
Audi TT bushing, note the orientation of the spaces in the bushing.&nbsp; If you
are using an Audi TT bushing, there is no up/down, left/right of the bushing.</p>
<p>I suggest using a press to remove the bushings.&nbsp; If you don't have
access to a press, use 2 sockets as drifts, between a vise, to push out the
small bushing.&nbsp; The larger bushing can also be pushed out with sockets and
a vise.&nbsp; You could also use a hole saw to cut most of the bushing
out.&nbsp; Then use a saw to cut the metal shell of the bushing, taking care to
not damage the LCA.&nbsp; Then use a punch to deform the metal bushing shell and
it should fall out.&nbsp; The new LCA can be pushed in.</p>
<p>Installation is the reverse of removal.&nbsp; Just remember to tighten the
suspension to the final torque in the loaded position.&nbsp; To do this, install suspension bolts
loose (not even wrench tight), rest the car on ramps,
then tighten the bolts to their final torque.</p>
<p> If the LCA is hanging
extended when you tighten the bolts, the bushings will wear out prematurely
because they are preloaded when sitting in the normal resting position.&nbsp; As a generic rule suspension bolts should be tightened with the car's
full weight on its wheels.&nbsp; If you don't, the bushings are tightened in a twisted position and will wear out.&nbsp;
To load
the suspension, rest the weight of the car on ramps or <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">wood
blocks</a>.&nbsp; You could use a hydraulic jack to raise the suspension arm in
relation to the body (this also puts the arms in the correct position) but be very careful to not
carry the weight of the car on the jack - this could cause the car to shift or
fall down!</p>
<h4>Ball joint replacement</h4>
<p>The 3x 13mm ball joint nuts are already off.&nbsp; Loosen the 18mm nut on top
of the ball joint.&nbsp; It will hit the driveaxle, keep loosening it and it'll
pop off.&nbsp; Otherwise, remove the axle and use an impact wrench to blip it
off.&nbsp; If you don't have an impact wrench, use a socket and counterhold the
shaft with an allen wrench to prevent spinning.&nbsp; These tend to hold up well so to
test for a bad ball joint, check for play by shaking the wheel in and out and
checking for play at the ball joint.</p>
<h4>Torque specs:</h4>
<p>front and rear LCA bolts: 52 ft-lbs + 1/4 turn<br>
3x 13 ball joint nuts: 15 ft-lbs + 1/4 turn<br>
18mm ball joint nut: 33 ft-lbs</p>
<p>sway bar bolt: either upper or lower are 11 ft-lbs</p>
