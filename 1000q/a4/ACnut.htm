<h2>An issue that some TDI have is a loose air conditioning (AC) compressor clutch pulley
nut.&nbsp; The clutch can fall off and become missing or even worse, can cause damage to the whole
area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> In most
cases it will be fine but since it only takes a second to tighten it, it's worth
taking a look if you're already down there.&nbsp; Summary of procedure: with the
engine off, take a 14mm wrench and tighten the nut - if you need more details,
see below.</p>
<h3>Parts</h3>
<p>14mm wrench<br>
blue locktite threadlocker</p>
<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Obviously the engine should be off before you do this!&nbsp; As a general tip, it's good practice to remove belts or watches,
necklaces, or other clothing which could gouge the paint or get caught in moving
parts.&nbsp; If you get any part of you or your clothing caught in moving belts
it can cause serious injury!</p>
<p> The AC compressor is a silver cylinder at the bottom of the engine in
front of the oil pan with two lines coming out of it.&nbsp; The two lines
lead to the AC &quot;radiator&quot; condenser which is by the engine coolant radiator.&nbsp; If you
still don't know where it is, stand at the passenger side of the engine and look
down.&nbsp; Follow the serpentine belt down and see the pictures below.</p>
<p> The center nut should be tightened to&nbsp;30
ft lbs, use a tiny dab of blue locktite since it's a one use
self locking nut.&nbsp; Counterhold the clutch plate when loosening the nut.</p>
<p>Note - the torque spec is for the Sanden compressor, if you have a bolt in
the center of the AC clutch you have the Zexel compressor.&nbsp; Torque for the
Zexel compressor bolt is 11 ft lbs and according to bentley, should be replaced
with new.&nbsp; I would use some light locktite so it doesn't come off again and
you will never have to touch it again.</p>

<p>Here is the view from underneath (pic is from a different writeup, ignore the
wrench).&nbsp; The AC nut is the middle nut on the funny looking pulley at lower
right of the picture.<br>
