<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>

<h2>This article shows how to change your engine oil on a mk4 VW Jetta TDI, VW Golf
TDI, or VW New beetle TDI</h2>

<p>The procedure for the
1998-2003 engines and 2004-2006 engines are pretty much the same.&nbsp; Although
the engine might look a little different, the engine oil filter and housing are
the same. If you have a 2005.5-2006 VW Jetta, please refer to the mk5 article here, <a href="../a5/engine-oil-change-Jetta-TDI.htm">1000q: mk5 engine oil change</a>.</p>

<p>For
types of VW approved oil and change intervals, refer to the article: <a href="../engineoilpump.htm">1000q:
engine oil for pumpe duse cars</a> or <a href="../engineoilNP.htm">1000q:
engine oil for non-pumpe duse cars</a>.&nbsp; You can use a
&quot;from the top&quot; oil extractor but it doesn't
give you a chance to inspect the bottom of the engine when you are underneath
the car draining the oil.&nbsp; The
advantage is that it's faster and you get out all of the engine oil, even the bit that is in oil filter housing.&nbsp; The disadvantage is that you have
to make sure the extractor tube is at the very bottom of the oil pan.&nbsp; If
it's not then you're not extracting all the oil.&nbsp; If you push
it too far the tip will curl up and not suck the bottom of the oil pan.&nbsp; A video of this
procedure is at the bottom.</p>

were manufactured with the &quot;top&quot; label on the bottom!&nbsp; When you
remove the old filter, note how it fits.&nbsp; The new filter should fit the
same way and will not fit correctly upside down.<br>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p><b>Torque specs:</b><br>
engine oil drain plug - 22 ft lbs<br>
oil filter cap - 18 ft lbs</p>

<p>If you spill some oil on the ground, first wipe it up with towels.&nbsp; Then
pour some driveway spill absorber or basic kitty litter on the spill.&nbsp; Step
and grind the litter into a dust and let it sit for a while.&nbsp; It needs time
to soak up the stain.&nbsp; When it's saturated, sweep up the gravel/dust.&nbsp;
Do not dump old engine oil onto
the ground or into the water!&nbsp; If you can't find a dump for used
coolant/antifreeze, engine oil, gear oil, or other car fluids, the website <a href="http://earth911.com/">earth911.com</a>
can search for a local waste disposal.</p>

<h4>Under the car method</h4>

<p>Engage the parking brake, jack up the front of the car using the factory jack
points, rest car securely on jack stands, chock the rear wheels, and make sure
the car is safe and secure before doing anything else.&nbsp; I use <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">wood
blocks that I made to help support the car</a> but always place jack stands at
the factory hack points before getting under the car.&nbsp; See the TOS
Agreement for the full legal disclaimer.&nbsp; See <a href="jackpoints.htm">1000q:
jack stand points</a> to see where the points were on my car.</p>

<p>Remove the oil filter (circled in green), pull out the old filter, and
replace.&nbsp; The filter is marked &quot;top&quot;, place that side against the
oil cap.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why you have to remove the oil filter first is
because there's a button that is opened when you remove the filter.&nbsp; This
drains a handful of oil out of the oil filter housing that would otherwise mix
with the new engine oil.&nbsp; The button is normally closed so that the filter
housing is full of oil and not air on cold starts.<br>

<p> There are also 2
o-rings on the cap shaft, replace them as well.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/oil3.jpg" width="540" height="403"></p>

<p>Remove the torx screws holding the plastic engine lower shield.</p>

<p>Place the catch pan under the oil plug and remove the oil plug (19mm x 1 bolt circled in
yellow).&nbsp; Make sure that you are not removing the transmission oil drain
plug!&nbsp; The oil plug is on the oil pan, which is at the bottom of the
engine.&nbsp; If you open the plug before removing the engine filter housing,
you'll find that some additional oil will come out.&nbsp; Again, this is why the
factory service manual recommends that you remove the filter first.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/oilchange2.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>Double check the engine oil drain plug and engine oil filter are
tightened.&nbsp; Do not overtighten the drain plug because the oil pan is
aluminum.&nbsp; Do not overtighten the oil filter cap - let the o-ring do its
job!&nbsp; After you put in the new filter, you can fill the filter housing with
engine oil.&nbsp; This will ensure maximum lubrication upon engine
start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p> Lower the car so
that the car is on level ground.&nbsp; Fill slightly less oil than specified and
check the level.</p>

<p>Wipe the dipstick clean and add oil until the level is between the
upper and lower marks on the dipstick.&nbsp; Too much oil is as bad as too little
oil.&nbsp; An oil level more towards the upper
mark is better since the engine will burn off a little oil over time.&nbsp;
Check for any oil leaks and recheck the level after a test drive and as needed.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Above the car method using an oil extractor</h4>

<p>The oil filter removal is the same. </p>

<p>Insert the oil extractor through the dipstick and suck the oil out.&nbsp; The
engine must be fully warmed or else the oil will flow very slowly.&nbsp; When
you're almost done, move the tube around to suck up the corners.&nbsp; Also
insert the extractor through the oil filter housing down into the oil cooler to
get it all out.&nbsp; The
rest of the procedure is the same.&nbsp; Here is a video showing extraction on a
new VW Jetta TDI (ignore the tips but it shows the basic procedure).<br>

<p>TDILow3 made an oil extractor storage sleeve using some PVC piping to keep the tubing clean. <a href="../../images/pdf/oil-extractor-sleeve.pdf">Here is a .pdf showing the project:</a><br>
