<h2>The euroswitch headlight switch has additional modes that the North American
headlight switch does not have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p> The E-code headlights (European specification)
also have additional modes that the North American headlight does not
have.&nbsp; Note that because they are not DOT approved lights, these
modifications are technically for off-road use only!&nbsp; For a more complete
list of US vs. E-code differences, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECE_Regulations</p>

<p>The euroswitch's turning positions are, turning clockwise: off, city light,
headlight.<br>
The euroswitch's pull/push positions are, pulling out: fog light off, front fog
light on, front and rear fog lights on.&nbsp; Below is a video showing some
more.<br><iframe width="480" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/-mdm9C6GZVE?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>Note that the euroswitch does not affect daytime running lights.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>You may also see city lights mentioned.&nbsp; City lights are small, dim 5w
lights that are supposed to be used in the city.&nbsp; You can see them lit in
the animated picture below, they are in the high beam housing.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>Note that you must have fog lights enabled for this to work!&nbsp; Here is an
animated picture of the lights in action.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is an example of an e-code headlight</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/vw-city-light.jpg" width="480" height="360"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that the eurolight has nothing to do with daytime running lights.&nbsp;
Installing a euroswitch by itself will not disable daytime running lights.&nbsp;
To do this, remove the headlight switch, and either bend, or put some electrical
tape over the TFL pin.&nbsp; See this article for more details: <a href="disable-drl-Jetta.htm">1000q:
disabling the DRL</a> .</p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<p>To change on the US-spec headlight switch to the euroswitch, just remove the
headlight switch, unplug, and replace.&nbsp; See this article for more details:&nbsp;
<a href="disable-drl-Jetta.htm">1000q:
disabling the DRL.</a></p>
<p>To change the headlights, just remove the front fascia and headlights, and
replace.&nbsp; Always make sure the battery is disconnected before doing any
work on the electrical system!&nbsp; For more details on removing the front
fascia, see this article: <a href="headlightfascia_removal.htm">1000q: removing
the headlights and fascia</a> .&nbsp;</p>
