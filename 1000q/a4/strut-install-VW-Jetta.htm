<h2>This article shows how to install strut/shocks on a Jetta, Golf, New Beetle
(for 1998-2006 mk4 body).&nbsp;&nbsp; </h2>
<p> Most pictures are mirrored and resized from
http://fortuneman.tripod.com/suspension/install.htm.&nbsp; The pictured springs
are H&amp;R which lower the car by 1.5&quot;, and Bilstein shocks.&nbsp; An alternative
strut installation is here: <a href="struts-replace-VW-Golf.htm">1000q: strut install:
first writeup.</a> and an <a href="http://www.noahlh.com/car/coilover_howto/">external
writeup here</a>&nbsp; Differences between this and the alternative writeup:
most of the text is the same but there are different pictures and slightly
different methods used.&nbsp; Reading both should give you a better idea of the
procedure.&nbsp; Related suspension links:&nbsp; <a href="LCA-bushing-Jetta.htm">1000q: lower control
arm removal</a> , <a href="sway-bar-bushing.htm">1000q:
sway bar bushing/endlink</a> &nbsp; </p>
<p>Shocks/struts, springs, and other suspension bushings and mounts were not
meant to last forever.&nbsp; As a rough test of strut condition,
push down on a corner of the car.&nbsp; If it bounces and returns in one or two
bounces, it is probably in good shape.&nbsp; The second bounce should be a lot
smaller than the first.&nbsp; Also look at the shock/strut damper
piston.&nbsp; If you can see the metal piston,
consider changing the boot because the boot serves to protect the seals from
dirt.&nbsp; Your VW TDI&nbsp;came stock with gas dampers.&nbsp; If you switched to liquid shocks,
check for pooled or a noticeable amount of liquid around the shock piston which
indicates bad shock seals.&nbsp; The OEM Boge/Sachs shocks are vilified because
they're soft but their construction quality is good.&nbsp; But because they're
so soft and combined with worn bushings, worn shocks result in a poor ride.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A decent suspension refresh should include: upper shock mounts, shocks,
front strut bearing, the lower control arm's rear bushing, and sway bar
bushings.&nbsp; If your car has high mileage or other problems are detected,
also consider the bump stops, ball joints, sway bar endlinks, and lower control
arm's front bushing.&nbsp; Bump stops are rubber bumpers at the top of the
shock.&nbsp; When you run out of suspension travel the bump stop prevents
metal-metal contact and effectively increases the spring's action.&nbsp; They're
cheap to replace but aren't normally worn out until higher mileage.</p>
<p>Shock/strut/damper are often used interchangeably.&nbsp; A damper is any
&quot;shock absorber&quot;.&nbsp; A McPherson strut is used on your VW, it
replaces the upper suspension arm and carries the spring on a perch.&nbsp; Struts do not change the ride
height unless the spring perch is different from stock (like the bilstein HD for VW).&nbsp; The springs carry the weight of the car and control ride
height, the struts just dampen the motion.&nbsp; On your VW, the fronts are
struts and the rear is a shock.</p>
<p>Here are some brand/models that people have been happy with in the past.&nbsp;
Just
remember that ride quality and harshness are highly subjective!&nbsp; Someone's
soft ride may feel hard to you.&nbsp; Sporty to one person may be &quot;kidney
bruising&quot; to you.&nbsp; The Monroe sensatracks are said to be comfortable.&nbsp;
The Koni reds are hydraulic and are adjustable.&nbsp; Koni reds on full soft are
about the same as new stock shocks.&nbsp; As a rough estimate, I would set them
at 1/2 turn from soft to 1 full turn from soft, depending on what you want and
tire size.&nbsp; The koni yellows are a
sport ride and comparable to the bilstein HD.&nbsp; The Bilstein TC (touring
class) shocks are gas economy twin tube design and is close the Koni reds but
different.&nbsp; The Bilstein HD are a stiffer gas monotube shock and a
good choice for a sportier (stiffer and rougher).&nbsp; Both are for stock
height suspensions.&nbsp; There are also TC sport suspension which are designed
to be used as replacement with the lowered sport suspension.&nbsp; These are
only for the lowered or sport suspensions because of the strut length!&nbsp; I avoid the OEM VW sachs or
boge replacements because they are expensive and are soft.&nbsp; Also remember that the tire
sidewalls are an important part of the suspension, taller tire sidewalls (higher
aspect ratio) will dampen more than thin short sidewalls.</p>
<p>Your car will need an alignment after strut replacement.&nbsp; Drive around for a
day or two to let the suspension settle in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caution: As a rule of thumb, always tighten all suspension
components in their normal resting position (not extended or fully
compressed)!&nbsp; Install suspension bolts loose-wrench tight, rest the car on ramps,
then tighten the bolts to their final torque.&nbsp; This prevents the bushings
from being preloaded and wearing out prematurely.&nbsp; To load
the suspension, rest the weight of the car car on ramps or <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">wood
blocks</a>.&nbsp; You could use a jack to raise the suspension arm but be very careful to not rest the weight of the car on it and watch for the car
shifting!&nbsp; The rear shocks on Jetta/Golf should be tightened with the
weight of 1 person in the rear.</p>

<p><b><font size="4">Parts</font></b> (click links to compare prices, always
double check the part # and quantity with your vendor)</p>
<p><b>Notes</b> - Some struts come with mounts, bearings, or boots so always
check before ordering those parts!&nbsp; Bilstein HD or Bilstein Sports have
internal bump stops, you don't need bump stops with these shocks.&nbsp; New rear
strut mounts are recommended.&nbsp; This will restore the bushing and some
report a clunking when not replaced.&nbsp; If you have good regular front bump
stops and are lowering the suspension, you can cut the old stops to get to the
correct length.&nbsp; In your manual, you will see a few stretch bolts or self
locking nuts used on the suspension, these are listed below.</p>

<h3>Procedure to install new shocks and struts</h3>
<p>Feel
free to sign up and ask a question about this article at the forums <a href="../../forum/index.php">here:
myturbodiesel.com forums</a></p>
<p>CAUTION - do not rest the weight of the car on the suspension or rear axle.&nbsp;
These can act like a fulcrum or move and cause the car to fall down.&nbsp; You need the
suspension to be able to move while you work on it.&nbsp; To preload the
suspension, rest the car on ramps or use a jack to raise the suspension arm (be
careful to not rest the weight of the car on it and watch for the car
shifting!)&nbsp; Always use the factory
jack points as specified in the service manual.&nbsp; Then chock the wheels,
apply the parking brake, and make sure the car is safe and secure before working
on it!&nbsp; Never get under the car while it's supported by hydraulic jacks
since these can fail - these are for raising the car only.&nbsp; This article is
not a substitute for the factory service manual or the services of a
professional mechanic.&nbsp; See the TOS Agreement for the full legal
disclaimer.</p>
<p>Summary: remove the bolts securing the struts and remove the strut assembly
from the car.&nbsp; Compress the spring with a spring compressor and
disassemble.&nbsp; Replace.</p>
<h3>Front struts</h3>
<p>Take off the front wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the 18mm bolts/nuts on the bottom of the strut.&nbsp; If it's rusty
you should soak it in PB Blaster and let sit.&nbsp; PB blaster makes it much
easier to remove rusted/seized fasteners.&nbsp; See <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
mechanic's tips</a> for more ideas.&nbsp; &nbsp; Remove the ABS sensor wire and brake pad sensor
wire, if equipped.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s2.jpg" width="867" height="545"></p>
<p>The strut is pinched in a cup.&nbsp; You have to spread the cup to pull the
strut up and out.&nbsp; You could use a heavy duty screwdriver or prybar but the
easiest way is to buy the Metalnerd strut spreader MN3424 linked above.&nbsp; It
fits in a 13mm socket/wrench and is the right shape/size to pry open the strut cup.&nbsp;
As you get the strut to come up a little bit, put some WD-40 or PB Blaster
around the edge of the strut to lubricate it further - this helps it come up
much easier.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/strut2.jpg" width="810" height="544"></p>
<h3>Getting enough clearance to remove the strut</h3>
<p>The author started on the right front.&nbsp; This is the harder side.&nbsp; Because the strut sits in a cup,
you need a little more clearance to pull it out on the right side.</p>
<p>The passenger side front strut doesn't have enough clearance to clear the
control arm.&nbsp; If you are also removing the control arm to replace the
bushing then just remove the 2x 18mm bolts that hold the control arm and the 3x
13mm ball joint bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not then you definitely won't have enough clearance.&nbsp; You
could lower the subframe on the right side by loosening the 2 subframe bolts on
that side.&nbsp; Support the subframe's weight
with a jack while you loosen the bolts.&nbsp; Don't take the bolt all the way
out since it will be difficult to put back, 1 inch should be enough clearance.&nbsp;
Once they are loosened, gently lower the subframe to get a little more
clearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is pictured below.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s3.jpg" width="896" height="505">&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s4.jpg" width="892" height="536">
</p>
<p>The Bentley says to remove the axle on the pass side.&nbsp; If you have the
large socket for the axle nut and don't want to remove the LCA or lower the
subframe, this is another option.</p>
<p>The last way to remove the strut is to compress the spring while it's still
on the car.&nbsp; This is risky because you could get pinched and you need
room to put on the spring compressors.&nbsp; Some need to be installed upside
down due to clearance and this could cause an issue when tightening the
compressors.&nbsp; <b>CAUTION</b>: Be careful when using spring compressors
since any failure or slipping could result in the sudden release of the spring,
strut, or other stuff on the assembly!&nbsp; Don't stick your hands near the
springs while the springs are being compressed!&nbsp; You could get pinched or
the spring compressors could fail!&nbsp; Always point the spring and strut away
from yourself so that if it does fail, it doesn't hit you!&nbsp; The socket is there because Autozone's
free loaner (with deposit) compressor is too long.&nbsp; (Always use 2 spring
compressors on opposite sites, pic is for illustration).&nbsp; For best results, put
some washers around it and lubricate the compressor's threads.&nbsp; You may
have noticed the painted dots on the spring, these are color codes to identify
spring rate.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/strut2a.jpg" width="709" height="531"></p>
<p>*If you have koni reds and want to adjust them without removing them from the
car, compress the springs, remove the strut nuts, and use an allen socket with
an extension to press down and turn the shaft.&nbsp; The shaft must be pressed
down all the way to turn the internal adjuster.</p>
<p>
Whichever method you used, you should have now have enough clearance to remove the strut
assembly.&nbsp; Make sure the brake line doesn't get pulled
or stressed!&nbsp; If the brake line is damaged then you could lose braking
action!&nbsp; While you're working on one side make sure the other side hasn't
fallen down!&nbsp; Shown below is ABS sensor wire removal.<br>

Pull off the plastic cover for the strut and remove the 21mm nut at the top
holding the strut.&nbsp; If you have an impact wrench, you can use it for
removal but don't use it for tightening that nut!&nbsp; Without an impact wrench, you have to counterhold
        the strut while loosening the nut.&nbsp; More on this below.&nbsp; For
New Beetle only:&nbsp; the strut tops are under a cover.&nbsp; Remove the
firewall rubber strip and lift the plastic windshield trim.&nbsp; Remove the
brackets and metal shelf (2x 10mm bolts) covering the strut tops to get access.<br>

<p>If you don't have an impact wrench, you can use the <a href="http://www.metalnerd.com/cat05.htm">Metalnerd
MN2122 strut counterholder</a> (pictured below and in use at right), a gearwrench pass through ratchet, a 13/16 spark plug socket, to counterhold the strut
shaft.&nbsp; If you don't, then the strut shaft will just spin and you won't
loosen anything.&nbsp; These techniques can also be used when you have to
tighten the nut.&nbsp; VW tool #3186 will work but it doesn't have sizes for
aftermarket nuts, the metalnerd MN2122 does.</p>
<p>The advantage of the metalnerd tool is that it has a square cutout for
adapting a torque wrench (always mate at 90<sup>o</sup> angle!), is cheaper than buying a
new wrench set, and works.&nbsp; It also has both 21mm and 22mm ends for OEM and
aftermarket struts.</p>

First strut removed.
        <p>Use the spring compressors to compress the springs.&nbsp; Lubricate
        the threads with WD-40 or grease so that there's less resistance to tightening it.&nbsp;
        <b>CAUTION</b>: Be careful when using spring compressors since any
        failure or slipping could result in the sudden release of the spring,
        strut, or other stuff on the assembly!&nbsp; Don't stick your hands near

        bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
If you don't have a spring compressor, they can be loaned at
many auto parts stores for free.&nbsp; Note the order of the bushings, mounts,
etc. </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>The strut mount rubber bushing on top should just pry off.&nbsp; Below that is
another nut that you have to counterhold or use an impact wrench on.&nbsp; The
        springs should stay compressed as you remove the nut holding the upper
        spring perch or else the spring will jump off.&nbsp; Note the order of the bushings, mounts,

While still compressed, put the new springs onto the new shock.&nbsp; Note the order.&nbsp;
Remember that you can't use an impact wrench to tighten the nuts, counterhold
the strut shaft against an allen wrench on the shock shaft.&nbsp; Use hand tools
to tighten.&nbsp; Both nuts torque: 44 ft- lbs.&nbsp; The
metalnerd tool has a spot to adapt a torque wrench (must be attached at a 90<sup>o</sup>
 angle or else it changes the lever arm and torque spec!) and has 21mm and 22mm sockets, another reason to
get it.&nbsp;&nbsp; For tips on how to use a torque wrench, see <a href="../torque-wrench-FAQ.htm">1000q:

<br>
Once in place, the lower bolt is torqued to 44 ft-lbs + a little over 1/4 turn.&nbsp;
The front suspension components
should be tightened in their normal resting position - not fully extended and not fully
compressed.&nbsp; Hand tighten the fasteners before loading the suspension and
tightening to their final torque.&nbsp; I lower the car onto ramps or <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">wood
blocks</a> to do this.&nbsp; You could use a hydraulic jack on the lower control
arm (with a wood block to avoid damaging the metal) to load the suspension but
make sure it doesn't carry the weight of the car and shift it off the jack
stands.&nbsp;
Make sure to tighten the subframe bolts if you loosened them, to 74 ft lbs + 1/4
turn.&nbsp; The lower control arm 18mm bolts/nut are 52 ft lbs +1/4 turn.&nbsp;
These bolts are all one use bolts.&nbsp; Replace the heat
shield or wires as needed.<br>

<p>Repeat for the left side.&nbsp; The front left side is easier since you don't
need to need to lower the subframe to get clearance.&nbsp; You may have to disconnect the antisway
bar, pictured below.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<h3>Rear suspension overhaul</h3>
<p>Raise the rear end, taking all the precautions as mentioned before - chock
the front wheels, rest the car on jack stands, etc.<br>
<br>
Use a hydraulic jack to load the rear suspension arm to a slightly loaded
position.&nbsp; The service manual says with the weight of 1 person in the
rear.&nbsp; This can be done by raising the rear suspension arm to a slightly
loaded position.</p>
<p>Counterhold the 16mm bolt/nut at the bottom of the shock and remove.&nbsp;
Remove the 2x 16mm bolts at the top mount.&nbsp; The shock will come out.&nbsp;
If you want to remove the springs, lower the jack and the spring will just come
out.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s19.jpg" width="795" height="525"><br>
<br>
If you are replacing the springs, pry out the springs.&nbsp; If not, leave them
alone.&nbsp; Just make sure to note the orientation of the spring against the
bushings.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s20.jpg" width="568" height="439"><br>
<br>
Remove the top strut mount (2x 16mm bolts).&nbsp; You can use an impact wrench
here
for removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s21.jpg" width="576" height="510"></p>
<p>Remove the top mount.&nbsp; As with the fronts, counterhold the strut shaft
while loosening the bolt.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/s22.jpg" width="957" height="490"></p>
<p>The bump stop threads into the protective plastic cover and pushes into the
upper mount.&nbsp; Torque the replacement locknut to 18 ft-lbs.
 </p>

<p>Again, the service manual says to tighten the rear suspension with the weight
of 1 person in the rear.&nbsp; This can be done by raising the rear suspension
arm to a slightly loaded position but make sure the hydraulic jack doesn't carry
the weight of the car!&nbsp; Make sure it doesn't shift off the jack stands!
