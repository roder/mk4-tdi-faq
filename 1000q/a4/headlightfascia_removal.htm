<h2>This article shows some steps for headlight or front bumper / fasica removal for the
VW Golf.&nbsp; The basic steps work on the Jetta.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p> There are slight differences between model years/models but the
general idea is the same.&nbsp; Original credit for pics is from http://home.nycap.rr.com/brandonc/headlight/,

<p>Headlight
      removal</p>

<p><img alt="a.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia1.jpg" width="553" height="417"></p>

<p>
                  Remove the plastic duct covers from both sides of the front
                  bumper. They have two tabs that hold them in place, as seen
                  below. Push down on the area below the tabs as you pull out on
                  the cover. This can be a little difficult.</p>

<p><img alt="b.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia2.jpg" width="551" height="418"></p>

<p>These are the tabs that hold the covers in place.</p>

<p><img alt="c.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia3.jpg" width="552" height="416"></p>

<p>
                  Remove the front grille. Use a scredriver to unhook the tab
                  located at 1. Then pull lightly on the spots marked 2 and they
                  will pop out. Push back and pull up on the spots marked 3 and
                  the will unhook from the bumper. Then do the same for 4. You
                  can leave the grill attached, as it will be held on by the
                  hood latch.</p>

<p><img alt="d.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia4.jpg" width="334" height="443"></p>

<p>
                  Turn the wheels all the way to the right, and remove the 4
                  screws shown from the fender liner. Then turn the wheels all
                  the way left and remove the 4 screws on the other side.</p>

<p><img alt="e.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia5.jpg" width="546" height="411"></p>

<p>
                  Remove the screw located where the duct covers were. Only
                  remove the circled one.</p>

<p><img alt="f.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia6.jpg" width="546" height="411"></p>

<p><br>
                  Same as above, other side.</p>

<p><img alt="g.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia7.jpg" width="547" height="412"></p>

<p>
                  Remove the circled screws. Be careful removing the last one,
                  as the bumper will no longer be connected to the car, except
                  for some wiring.</p>

<p><img alt="h.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia9.jpg" width="548" height="414"></p>

<p>
                  CAREFULLY pull out on the bumper, and set it down in front of
                  the car. It will still be connected by the wiring for the
                  corner lights (and outside temp sensor if you have a GLX)</p>

<p><img alt="i.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia10.jpg" width="548" height="410"></p>

<p>
                  Remove these screws.</p>

<p><img alt="j.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia11.jpg" width="548" height="414"></p>

<p><br>
                  Remove these as well, and the headlight can be pulled out.</p>

<p><img alt="k.jpg" src="../../images/a4/fascia12.jpg" width="550" height="412"></p>

<p><br>
                  Remove the wiring harness (A) from the connector on the
                  headlight (B). There's a clip that you need to press on on the
                  underside of the harness.&nbsp; You're done!! Now you can replace the bulbs as needed. Make
                  sure that the cover on the back of the housing is sealed back
                  up before installing the headlight again.</p>

<p>There were some differences over the years so watch out for those.</p>
