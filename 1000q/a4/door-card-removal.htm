<h2> If
you want to add soundproofing, service the window regulator clips, door locks, speakers, or
reupholster the doors, you must first remove the door cards on your VW.</h2>

<p> Note that the driver's side door is slightly different than the other
doors because of the extra electrical switches.&nbsp; The small triangular rear
window trim also tends to rust - removing the rear door panels is the only way
to remove them for repainting.&nbsp; See <a href="tritrim.htm">1000q: triangle
trim removal for more details</a>&nbsp; Also see <a href="../multi/soundproofing-car.htm">1000q:
soundproofing</a> for some basic soundproofing tips.&nbsp; Refer to&nbsp; <a href="../multi/window-regulator-repair-VW.htm">1000q:
window regulator clip and motor replacement</a> if your window is clicking,
popping, or fell into the door.</p>

<h3> Tools</h3>

<p> T25 torx screwdriver<br>
slot screwdriver or pry<br>
phillips screwdriver</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<h3>Driver's side door card removal</h3>
<p>Pull the inside handle edge (outlined in red) out and parallel to the ground.&nbsp; It is
held only by clips.&nbsp; If you use a screwdriver, wrap it in cloth to protect
the plastic.&nbsp; </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/door1.jpg" width="639" height="374"></p>
<p>The rest of the handle should just pop up and out, remove the one plug for the
windows/doors, etc, outlined in green. You may want to wear gloves for this
because there are sharp edges in the metal and plastic.&nbsp; When you pull on
the clips, etc., they let go suddenly and you may slice yourself on an edge. It
will also prevent you from getting dirty fingerprints all over the interior.<br>

<p>Remove 3 torx screws at the bottom, 1 phillips screw near the driver's side
view mirror (outlined in yellow)<br>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/door4.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>You can now pull up and out, starting at the bottom edge, and moving to the window
seam where the door card hooks into the door edge.&nbsp; There are six plastic
snaps holding the door card, pull up and out to pull these out.&nbsp; Here is
the reverse side of the door to show you the plastic snaps (circled in
red).&nbsp; Remove the door electrical plugs for the trunk and gas cap release and door latch wire.<br>

<p>To remove the door latch wire, pull the plastic holder forward and away from
the door in the
direction of the blue arrow.&nbsp; Note that the wire goes into the tube
(outlined in red) and is locked in place by the plastic holder (outlined in
green, old position outlined by green dashes).&nbsp; You can then unhook the
door latch wire (outlined in yellow).&nbsp; Remember their original positions for reinstallation.<br>

<p>Here is the inside door panel.&nbsp; Note the door latch hook.&nbsp; When
reinstalling the driver's side door, make sure you pull up all the window
control wires through their holes before you reattach the door or else they will
be stuck inside the door.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/fdoor.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p>The other doors are pretty much the same.&nbsp; The passenger side door has a
handle that has to be split in half with a screwdriver or pick.&nbsp; 2 phillips
screws hold the door in place, remove them.&nbsp; The three smaller screws hold
the handle to the door card, it's not necessary to remove them unless you want
to remove the handle from the door card.<br>

<h3>Rear doors</h3>
<p>The rear doors have two torx screws on the bottom and the same style door
handle that must be removed, everything else is the same. (torx screws and
plastic snaps outlined in red)<br>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/interior/door9.jpg" width="611" height="407"></p>

<p>For reinstallation, double check that all wires and door latches are
reattached before putting it back on.&nbsp; Hook the door at the top, at the
window seal first, then press in the plastic snaps from outside.&nbsp; You
should hear them click, you may also have to bang it gently with your hand to
make it click.&nbsp; Then reinstall the torx screws.</p>

<p>Pictured below is the rear door.&nbsp; The red circle marks the location of the bolt that
holds the rear triangular trim piece that gets rusty.&nbsp; See <a href="tritrim.htm">1000q:
triangular trim</a> for more details.</p>
