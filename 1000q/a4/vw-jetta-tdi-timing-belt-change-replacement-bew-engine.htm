<h2>
This article shows how to replace the BEW VW TDI engine timing belt found on
Golf and New Beetle TDI 2004-2006 and VW Jetta TDI 2004-2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>

<p> The factory
change interval is before every 100,000 miles with an inspection at 80,000 and
90,000 miles.&nbsp; Also replace the rollers/tensioner/water pump because they will
most likely not last another 100,000 miles and replacement requires timing belt
removal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the timing belt or components will probably cause
severe damage to the cylinder head and maybe the whole engine.</p>
<p>If you find the tips on this page helpful, please use the donation button at the top so that I can continue to keep publishing great articles. The Bentley service manual is about $80 and doesn't even mention most of the tips here. This page has color photos, more detail, and videos. I know it will save you some money even if you're just reading this to know your mechanic should be doing. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Part 1 shows how to remove
the timing belt.&nbsp; Part 2 shows installation and final checks.&nbsp; Disclaimer- this article is revised and
updated to include the most current information but is not a substitute for the
factory service manual!&nbsp; See the TOS Agreement for the full legal
disclaimer.&nbsp; Although a timing belt job can successfully be done with
basic tools plus the timing belt tools and basic mechanical experience,
improper installation of the timing belt can cause severe engine damage so take
all precautions listed in the factory service manual.&nbsp; If you have never
worked on a car, I suggest gaining experience with easier projects first
before doing something as critical as a timing belt!</p>


<h3>Note about the VW TDI BEW engine</h3>


<p>
If you've never done a TDI engine, the main difference is that you must
buy/rent/borrow the timing belt tools.&nbsp; The crankshaft lock tool is a
fine fit and cannot be substituted.&nbsp; During
timing belt tensioning, the
camshaft sprocket rotates independently of the hub underneath it.&nbsp; This sets
belt tension evenly.&nbsp; Unlike many
engines, you can't just remove and replace the belt by marking it because there
are no accurate index marks on the timing belt.&nbsp; You must also remove the
motor mount because it's in the way.</p>

<p>Some more tips:&nbsp; If you're not familiar with the engine bay, label the fuel
lines and plugs/wires that you remove with a piece of tape and marker, not pencil.&nbsp; It will make
installation much easier, especially if you are doing other maintenance items
over more than 1 day.&nbsp; See <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
tips for the mechanic</a> for more handy tips.&nbsp; Please read all of the
instructions thoroughly and check your parts before attempting timing belt replacement.&nbsp; If
you have any questions regarding the tips on this page for replacing the BEW VW
TDI engine timing belt, don't hesitate to ask at the forums linked here: <a
href="../../forum/index.php">myturbodiesel.com forums</a>.&nbsp; If you are not
comfortable that you can successfully do this job after reading the instructions
in your factory service manual and the tips on this page, take it to an
experienced VW TDI mechanic!</p>

<h3><span style='font-size:13.5pt'>Tools and Parts for timing belt replacement</span></h3>

<p>(click links
to compare current prices and kit components, shipping, tax, etc. )&nbsp;&nbsp;1 timing belt kit with some G12/Pentosin coolant and a timing belt special tool
set is suggested.</p>

<p><b>1 timing belt kit (recommended)</b> - from <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-319/A4-BEW-100,000-mile/Detail" target="_blank">Kermatdi</a>, <a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/BEW_TDI_Timing_Kit_s/1822.htm" target="_blank">Dieselgeek</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://metalmanparts.com/product.sc?productId=136&amp;categoryId=-1" target="_blank">MetalManparts

exact supplier as genuine VW and are the same exact part without the VW box.&nbsp;
The different kits contain
different components and are all sold by well known TDI vendors.&nbsp; Below are the individual components.</p>

<p><b>CAUTION</b> - generic parts available on ebay or other online sellers may
be of questionable origin since some similar parts
are also used on other VW/Audi engines.&nbsp; The above linked sites are all
well known and experienced TDI vendors.</p>

<p><b>CAUTION</b> - I would not buy the <span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img
border=0 id="_x0000_i1066" src="../../images/badseller.gif" width="452" height="21"></span>or
any other of this seller's copycat sites' timing belt kit.&nbsp; These are
almost certainly low quality copycat parts!&nbsp; It's not worth saving a few
dollars on critical engine parts when it could result in thousands of dollars of
engine damage!&nbsp; I and many others have had bad experiences with
this seller so never again.</p>

<p>I prefer the metal impeller water pump over the plastic impeller water pump
because the plastic can sometimes fail and spin on the shaft. It's rare but it happens.</p>

<h3><span style="mso-no-proof: yes">Procedure - </span>timing belt removal</h3>

<p>If you wish to use a service cover, do so now.&nbsp; I tape an old clean
towel to the fender to prevent scratches from belt buckles, jeans buttons, or
watches.&nbsp;
Also make sure you don't have loose necklaces, hair, sleeves when
working on your car, consult your factory service manual for all cautions,
always wear eye protection, see the TOS for the full legal disclaimer, etc..</p>

<p>Pull the engine cover straight off to remove it.&nbsp; There are some pop
snaps that hold it on.</p>

<p>Raise the car and rest it securely on jack stands.&nbsp; See <a href="jackpoints.htm">1000q:
jack points</a> for some pictures of where the factory jack points are.&nbsp;
Make sure the car is safe and secure before getting underneath it.</p>

<p>Remove the plastic splash shield under the car by removing a few T25 torx
screws.&nbsp; If you wish to replace it with a metal skid plate due to low
ground clearance, see <a href="Skid-plate-install.htm">1000q: skid plate installation</a>.</p>

<p>Drain the engine coolant in the radiator.&nbsp; There's a valve at the bottom
corner of the radiator.&nbsp; Use a hose to divert it into a bucket.&nbsp; See <a href="coolant-flush-TDI.htm">1000q:
coolant flush</a>  and <a href="water-pump-replace-TDI.htm">1000q: water pump replacement</a>
for more pics and details.&nbsp; You don't need to do a full flush during a routine timing belt change since most of it will be
drained anyways.</p>

<p>Remove the coolant reservoir overflow hose and coolant sensor plug.&nbsp;
Also remove the 2x phillips screws holding the coolant reservoir down (yellow
arrows in below pic).&nbsp; This is a good time to check for coolant
migration, see <a href="../multi/coolant-migration-VW-Audi.htm">1000q: coolant
migration</a> for more details.&nbsp; Once it's loose, remove the hose
underneath the coolant reservoir and tuck it to the side.</p>

<p> Remove the fuel lines at the fuel filter (white arrows in below pic) and tuck
one end to the side.&nbsp; Also unclip them from the plastic intercooler
output pipe.&nbsp; After removing each spring clamp, twist the hose
to break the seal before pulling it off.&nbsp; This makes it much easier to
remove the hoses and helps prevent damage to the line.&nbsp; If they won't come
off, remove them at the engine side.&nbsp; Note the blue and white arrows and mark which is the
feed and which is the return line.&nbsp; Diesel fuel
melts rubber and asphalt driveways so wad a rag around the ends to prevent excessive spilling.&nbsp;
Tightly wrap some clean rags or paper towels around the exposed fuel lines to avoid
contamination.&nbsp;</p>

<p> Optional: change the fuel filter if it's due for its 20,000 mile
change.&nbsp; See <a href="fuel-filter-change-TDI-engine.htm">1000q: fuel filter change</a>
if you need more tips.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb1.jpg" width="846" height="519"></p>

<p>Remove the 5mm allen bolt holding the power steering reservoir down (red
arrow in the above picture).&nbsp; Move the power steering reservoir and line
around as needed for clearance but don't disconnect the lines.</p>

<p>Remove the plastic intercooler output pipe (it's the hose you've been working
around).&nbsp; There's a shielded electrical wire stuffed in the side, move it
to the side.&nbsp; This will give you more clearance.&nbsp;
There is 1 spring clip at each end holding it down.&nbsp; Tape over the
open pipes so nothing falls into them.&nbsp; I try to
avoid using paper towels because they tend to get stuffed down the piping but
the pipes may be oily and prevent the tape from sticking.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb2.jpg" width="720" height="281"></p>

<p>If the retaining tabs on the rubber hose are worn off, it will cause a
massive boost leak and poor running.&nbsp; You can use an <a href="http://www.kermatdi.com/servlet/-strse-378/Pumpe-Duse-Intake-Hose-fdsh-Manifold/Detail">aftermarket
doggie collar</a> or replace the hose.&nbsp; For the BEW engine the hose is VW# 1j0 145 838 t<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb13.jpg" width="720" height="540"></p>

<p>Remove the serpentine belt&nbsp; (alternator/power steering/AC belt).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Place a wrench on the serpentine belt tensioner to align the hole in the
tensioner and tensioner body.&nbsp; Insert VW tool T10060 or equivalent to hold it in the
loosened position (you can also use a nail).&nbsp; You don't need to hold the
tensioner back but it makes accessing the 3x 13mm bolts holding it on easier.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/tdi-tensioner.jpg" width="392" height="523"><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb3.jpg" width="864" height="523"></p>

<p>Remove the serpentine belt tensioner (3x 13mm bolts) and the upper timing belt cover
to its left/aft (2 clips).<br>
<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb7.jpg" width="360" height="390">
<span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0
id="_x0000_i1053" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb11.jpg" width="334" height="507"></span></p>

<p>If the car is not on jackstands yet, engage the parking brake, jack up the
car, <a href="jackpoints.htm"> rest the car securely on jack stands</a>, chock the wheels, and make sure the
car is stable, safe and securely raised before doing anything else.&nbsp; I use
wood blocks to raise the car.&nbsp; Here are instructions and some more useful
tips: <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm">1000q:
tips for the mechanic</a> , <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">1000q: making wood blocks</a>.</p>

<p>Remove the plastic splash shield under the car (bunch of T25 torx screws).</p>

<p>Remove the passenger side side splash shield (2 speed nuts, one is yellow
arrow).&nbsp; Remove the speed nuts by sticking a screwdriver in the gaps and
turning it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb4.jpg" width="810" height="507">
</p>

<p>Here is a picture of it removed.&nbsp; The speed nuts (silver discs) slide
into little clips.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb11.jpg" width="714" height="310">
</p>

<p>At the same time, remove the 10mm &quot;nut to body&quot; nut and clip holding the piping to the
intercooler (green arrows above).&nbsp; Thread it back onto the stud to avoid
losing it.&nbsp; Move the intercooler pipe to the side.&nbsp;
There's a rubber elbow at the turbo which will let you bend it.&nbsp; I don't
suggest removing the rubber hose because there should be room to bend it to the
side and work around it.&nbsp; Pictured below is an older type
hose - yours is the same except the intercooler side uses a wire clip instead of
a spring clamp.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/timingbelt27.jpg" width="456" height="340">
</p>

<p>Remove the 4 bolts on the harmonic balancer
pulley (crankshaft pulley/serpentine belt pulley).&nbsp; If you have a rubber
cover over them just pull it out.&nbsp; <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>Caution</b>:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>The pulley you are removing is the crankshaft
pulley/serpentine
belt pulley/harmonic balancer pulley only!<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Do not remove the
crankshaft sprocket bolt, the large rusty bolt 19mm 12 point bolt in the above
picture.&nbsp; It's a one use only torque to yield bolt so
don’t remove it or apply a very large force to it.
</p>

<p>If there is any corrosion or resistance, I
suggest soaking the bolts in PB Blaster or another penetrating lubricant.&nbsp;
The bolt heads are easy to strip.&nbsp; Let them
soak since PB blaster needs time to soak and penetrate into the threads and
under the bolt heads.&nbsp; When
satisfied, counterhold the pulley by having someone put the car in gear and
stepping on the brakes.&nbsp; If the pulley still moves, use a 19mm 12 point
wrench on the middle bolt to counterhold even more.&nbsp; If the
bolts get stripped, use an EZ out stripped bolt extractor to grip the outer diameter of the bolt heads.&nbsp;
If the harmonic balancer is stuck after the bolts are removed, use a rubber
mallet or a piece of wood to gently knock it back and forth to wiggle it off.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 4 bolt holes are not
symmetrical.&nbsp; The pulley will only go on with the holes oriented in the
correct orientation.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb5.jpg" width="810" height="613"><span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0

</p>

<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb6.jpg" align="right" width="503" height="201"><b>CAUTION</b>: Some may be 6mm allen head and some may be 10mm triple square
bolts (not torx!) I believe the allen head bolts are long but check the length of the original bolts against the length of
the new bolts!&nbsp; Some timing belt kits include replacement allen head
bolts (pictured below) which may be too long for your pulley if you have triple
square bolts!&nbsp; The pictures above show a
pulley that requires the short style bolts.&nbsp; It doesn't have the raised
ridges.&nbsp; Some pulleys have 4 raised ridges to accommodate the long bolts
(similar to the below picture from an
earlier engine).&nbsp; Some came
with short allen head bolts, some came with short triple square bolts, and some
came with long bolts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p> The OEM allen head bolts also tend to strip.&nbsp; The triple square bolts
are less likely to strip assuming you didn't try to jamb a torx bit into
them.&nbsp; The torque spec includes a &quot;+1/4
turn&quot; which suggest they are single use torque to yield bolts but the
service manual for the BEW or later pumpe duse engines don't say to replace them
so I don't know which is best.&nbsp; If you have replacements that fit I would
use them.
</p>

<p>Remove the black lower timing belt cover (5x 10mm bolts).&nbsp; The middle-lower cover
overlaps the lower-lower round cover.&nbsp; Note the tabs on the edges.&nbsp; (Pic
is from a similar engine, your car will look slightly different).&nbsp; The fuzz
on the backside is normal but wipe off any oil and dirt.<br>
<span style='mso-no-proof:yes'><img border=0

</p>

<p> 
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/vw-t10050.jpg" align="right" alt="vw tdi t10050 tool" width="384" height="400"> Set the engine to top dead center (TDC) by manually turning the 19mm 12 point bolt on the
crankshaft clockwise to test fit the crankshaft lock and camshaft pin.&nbsp; If manual, the transmission should be in neutral when you turn the engine over
or else the
transmission will hold the engine.&nbsp; Since you chocked the wheels and
applied the parking brake the car won't roll away.&nbsp; Do not apply strong force to
the crankshaft bolt like an impact wrench because it's a one use only stretch
bolt.&nbsp; It's safe to use the bolt to turn the engine over by hand because
the force is low compared to the bolt's torque
value and this is how the service manual says to turn the engine over.&nbsp; Do
this after removing the serpentine belt because otherwise you'll be turning
those too and using more effort.&nbsp; The service manual suggests doing this after removing
the motor mount -&nbsp; I suggest doing this before removing the mount because the engine will be
more stable.</p>
<p>While you could also turn the engine over at the camshaft
sprocket using a counterhold bar, this is not recommended. Despite having more teeth engaging the timing belt, it pulls on the tensioner side of the belt instead of the water pump side of the belt. This stresses the tensioner so don't turn it over there unless you're discarding the tensioner.</p>

<p>The crankshaft is at TDC when the dash mark on the crankshaft sprocket is
aligned with the arrow on VW tool# T10050.&nbsp; When inserting the tool, slide it into the teeth on the sprocket
(moving towards the engine) - don't push it down (moving down towards the
ground) or else the teeth won't be meshed.&nbsp; As a test, pull the tool up (away from the
ground) and if the teeth are meshed it won't lift up.&nbsp; There is a peg on the backside
where the tool's handle is which fits into a
hole on the crank front flange.&nbsp; The peg is visible in the tool pics at the
top of the page.</p>

<p> When inserting the tool, insert it while gently
turning the crankshaft clockwise.&nbsp; There's a little play and it will be off
if you insert it while turning the engine/crankshaft sprocket counter
clockwise.&nbsp; If you miss, the service manual says to turn it 1/4 turn
counterclockwise before trying again.&nbsp; If you didn't read the warning
earlier, here it is again: VW made a few defective T10050 whose arrows were to
the right of the handle's hole.&nbsp; The arrow should be to the left of that
and in line with one of the bolt holes at the 11:30 o'clock position.
</p>

<p>The camshaft is at TDC when VW tool# T3359 can be fully inserted into the hole in the cylinder head.&nbsp; The toothed
window should be near the top and not near the bottom.&nbsp; If the toothed window is in the lower half of the sprocket, turn the crankshaft 1 full revolution.&nbsp; Make sure that the pin is fully inserted in the hole!&nbsp; It goes through the sprocket, through the hub that the sprocket mounts onto, and into the hole on the cylinder
head.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb14.jpg" width="638" height="520"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb13.jpg" width="598" height="380"></p>

<p>Here is a view with the camshaft sprocket removed, the pulley removed for
illustration (the
pulley should not be
removed so don't loosen the large center bolt), and a view from straight on.&nbsp; Use a mirror to confirm the
position of the hole.&nbsp; Make
sure you're not inserting the pin into the empty space way below the hole.&nbsp;
(If you've triple checked the hole position with a mirror and find that the pin
is a hair off and won't go in, that's OK.&nbsp; Once you remove the timing
belt you can use the 18mm center bolt to slightly wiggle the camshaft hub 1 or 2
degrees to insert the pin.&nbsp; If it's more than a hair off something is
wrong.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb20b.jpg" width="387" height="319"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb20c.jpg" width="225" height="319"><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb20a.jpg" width="425" height="319"></p>

<p> The Bentley service manual mentions a &quot;mark on the rear timing belt
cover&quot; but it's blocked by the belt.&nbsp; There is another mark &quot;4Z&quot; stamped into the
rear cover which roughly lines
up with the camshaft sensor tabs.&nbsp; These marks are highlighted in yellow below.&nbsp; You
can ignore these marks because they are just there to locate the pin's hole and the toothed window is much more visible.<br>

<p>Raise the engine about 1/4&quot;, just enough to
get the weight of the engine off the passenger side engine mount and put the
passenger side engine mount to be
in a neutral position.&nbsp; By getting the weight off the engine mount, it's
less likely to strip the threads in the aluminum mount.&nbsp; If the mount
threads get stripped,
get a new mount since the engine can fall down if the 18mm bolts strip or break.</p>

<p>The factory method to support the engine is to use a support bracket above the car.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Refer to your
service manual for more details on the bracket.&nbsp; If you want to buy a
support bracket like the one pictured below, they are available at Northern
Tool or Harbor Freight.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Loop chains
through the engine lift loop or loop chains through a shackle or large+thick
bolt and secure them to the hooks hanging down from the support.&nbsp; Make sure
the engine is secure and steady before removing the mount!&nbsp; Make sure your
support/chain/bolt/shackle is rated to support the engine/transmission!<br>

<p>The support bracket can also raise and lower the engine.&nbsp; As an aid in
raising/lowering the engine I use a hydraulic jack on the oil pan with a piece
of wood as a buffer (so it doesn't crack the aluminum oil pan).&nbsp; This
should not be the primary method of supporting the engine because hydraulic jacks can suddenly fail.&nbsp;
Never put yourself in a position where you could be injured if the
jack or engine slips/falls because it may cause damage to property and/or
serious injury/death!&nbsp; Before removing the motor mount, make sure the
engine is secure!<br>

<p>Loosen all the bolts circled below about a single turn before removing
them.&nbsp; This will help hold the mount and engine steady.&nbsp; Then
completely remove them.&nbsp; Ignore the torque values, that's for
installation.&nbsp; Again, you must securely support the
engine BEFORE you remove the red or blue circled bolts or else the engine will
fall down!&nbsp; Also note the alignment of the mount since the 18mm bolts have a
little bit of adjustment range.&nbsp; This is explained more in part 2 -
installation.<br>

<p>It should look something like this after removal.&nbsp; The engine support is
holding the engine up since you removed the mount.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pdtb10.jpg" width="720" height="533"></p>

<p>Then remove the other motor mount on the engine (3x 16mm bolts).&nbsp; These
are tricky to get at because the wheel well is blocking access to all 3 bolts at the
same time.&nbsp; Raise and lower the engine for access.&nbsp; Here is the same mount pictured on an
earlier engine.&nbsp; Don't bother trying
to remove the mount until the timing belt rollers are removed because there
isn't enough clearance yet.&nbsp; For now, just work around it.&nbsp; If you can
get it out later, good, otherwise just work around it.</p>

<p> The upper right bolt is longer (about
120mm long) than the other 2 bolts (about 94mm long).&nbsp; If the shorter 16mm
bolt holes or the engine mount tab on the engine block are broken you can use
the <a href="http://www.dieselgeek.com/Broken_VW_engine_block_bracket_ALH_BEW_TDI_p/vg-mk4alh-fslash-bew.htm" target="_blank">mount repair kit
from dieselgeek</a> to fix it.&nbsp; Although the service manual doesn't suggest
replacing these bolts, some mechanics do it because they are holding the engine
up and repeated use could cause failure.&nbsp; New bolts will stress the
mounting tab less but it normally breaks from under/over torquing the bolt.&nbsp;
Below is a similar engine for illustration (mount is the same).<br>

      <p>Release tension on the timing belt tensioner by loosening its 15mm
nut.&nbsp; Insert a 6mm allen wrench or spanner wrench VW# 3387 (fits in the 2
      pegs) into the center part and
turn it counter clockwise.&nbsp; If the tensioner is being reused, the service
      manual says to insert the
triangle lock pin, VW tool# T10115.&nbsp; The tensioner will stay in
      the released position even if you don't use the VW triangle pin.&nbsp; You should
never reuse an old tensioner during routine timing belt changes since it will almost certainly
      fail before the next scheduled service.&nbsp;
Since tensioners are so cheap, I suggest replacing it with a new one every time
the timing belt is removed unless it was just changed.</p>
      <p><img border="0" src="../../images/a5/tb/tb21.jpg" width="534" height="402"></p>

<p>Remove the idler pulley (13mm nut).&nbsp; It will not last until the
next scheduled service so always replace it.&nbsp; Don't tighten the new nut
yet.&nbsp; If you can slip off the belt do it now.</p>

<p>If the belt is too tight, remove the 3x 13mm camshaft sprocket bolts but don't
loosen or turn the center 18mm bolt.&nbsp; If you move the 18mm center bolt it
will move the camshaft and you don't want that.&nbsp; Removing the camshaft
sprocket will not move the camshaft.&nbsp; You have to remove the pin VW tool
T3359 to remove the sprocket but don't worry, the camshaft won't move and the pin
will go back in with no problem later.</p>

<p>Remove the water pump.&nbsp; It should be replaced before every 100,000 miles
as part of the timing belt replacement.&nbsp; See <a href="water-pump-replace-TDI.htm">1000q:
engine water pump replacement
</a> for more details. </p>
