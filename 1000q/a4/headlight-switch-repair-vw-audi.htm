<h2>This article shows how to remove the headlight switch and repair it on a mk4 VW. The mk6 Jetta TDI (not GLI or hybrid) uses a similar switch.</h2>
<p>I recently had a problem with my headlight switch. I would turn on the switch light on and the head lights would come on, but the dash lights wouldn't. But if I turned the switch off and on a few times then the headlights and dash lights would work again. 
After reading some posts here and finding a post about replacing the leds in the headlight switch I though I'd try cleaning the switch. Since I haven't seen any other how-to's on this I though I'd share some photos.</p>

<h2>Procedure
</h2>
<p>First remove the headlight, below is a video showing this and a brief explanation of the euroswitch</p>

<p>First I removed the switch. Leave the switch in the "Unlocked" position that it was when it was removed (or put it back that way). Leave the switch in the "Unlocked" position that it was when it was removed (or put it back that way).<br>

<p>Remove the front cover ring. 
There are some clips around the edge that hold it on. Here it is removed:<br>

<p>Once the cover ring is removed you can remove the front section of the   switch to get to the board that holds the LEDs. You may have to cut the   sticker on the side of the switch assembly.<br>

</p>
<p>Once you have the front portion of the switch unclipped from the back it   will move forward, but you must rotate it until the spline on the side   of the shaft is aligned properly and can slide out.<br>

</p>
<p>You can easily remove the PCB with the LEDs simply by pulling or prying   it at the locations where the LED leads are pressed in to the punch   downs. This isn't a euro switch and doesn't have fog light so it doesn't have as many LEDs as some.<br>

<p>Here is a view of the back of the front portion of the switch. You can   see the spline on the shaft which rotates when you turn turn the switch.<br>

<p>Once removed from the light switch. I wish that I had taken a picture of   the back which is more interesting. If any LEDs are burnt out they can   be replaced, but be sure to check the polarity.<br>

<p>Here is the remaining portion of the switch with the points where the   board with the LEDs attach. We'll remove the inner portion of this.<br>

<p>There are four clips (two on each side) that hols the portion of the   switch that has contacts inside. Gently list on them to release them   while pushing the core out from the back. I used a flat head screwdriver   to lift these tabs.<br>

<p>To remove the core push gently on the centre while making sure that you have released the four clips that hold it in place.<br>

<p> Once it's unclipped the core will slide right out.<br>

<p>The contacts were oxidized and needed a cleaning. I cleaned the contacts   on this switch with Detoxit, q-tips and some white paper. Alcohol would   work if you don't have detoxit. I suppose that you could disassemble it   further, but I don't see the need as long as you don't bend anything   while cleaning it.<br>

<p>Once I cleaned the contacts and put it back together it worked fine and   got my dash lights to come on whenever my headlights are on once again.<br>
