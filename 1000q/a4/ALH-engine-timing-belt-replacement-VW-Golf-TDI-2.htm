<h2>This article shows how to install the new timing belt on the TDI engine and final
adjustments on the injection pump.</h2>

<p><b><font size="4">Procedure</font></b></p>
<p>The camshaft lock bar (and its feeler gauges/business cards), crankshaft lock, and injection pump pin lock should
all be in place.</p>
<p>If you removed the engine mount instead of working around it, you know how
tricky it can be to reinstall it.&nbsp; Loosely put it in position so that it
stays out of the way and you can work around it until you get the belt and
rollers on.&nbsp; After you get the rollers and belt on, loosely hand tighten
the mount in position.</p>
<p>Install a new tensioner pulley.&nbsp; The two holes for the spanner wrench should be at the
bottom.&nbsp; Make sure the tensioner's tab (called tensioning roller retaining
lug in the Bentley service manual) is inserted into its alignment slot
(indicated below with red arrow and in more pictures below).&nbsp; Tighten the 13mm nut
loosely finger tight only.&nbsp;
The purpose of finger tight only is so that when you tighten
the tensioner in a later step, the camshaft and injection pump sprockets can
rotate, spreading the tension evenly across the timing belt (the cam lock and
injection pump lock should be in place so that although their shafts are locked,
their sprockets are be free to rotate).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/tab.jpg" width="628" height="466"></p>
<p>Here is a picture of the
tab not in its slot (pic by rallysmurf).&nbsp; It should not look like this.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/tbalign3.jpg" width="480" height="411"></p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/timingbelt24a.jpg" align="right" width="627" height="694">The large roller uses a 16mm <u> stretch bolt</u>, you should replace the roller and
bolt with new ones, tighten to 30 ft lbs + 1/4 turn.&nbsp; Also change the small rollers and <a href="water-pump-replace-TDI.htm">water pump</a>.&nbsp;
Torque specs also at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Put the new belt on.&nbsp; Note the belt
      routing.&nbsp; Slip the belt over
the camshaft sprocket and then slide the camshaft sprocket onto the taper.&nbsp;
The sprocket and taper surface should be clean and free of oil or grease.</p>
<p>
Put the 19mm camshaft sprocket bolt on and firmly hand tighten the bolt so that
you know the sprocket is on correctly and flat on the taper.&nbsp; Then loosen
the bolt about 1 or 2 turns so that there is no resistance to letting it
rotate.&nbsp; Wiggle and rotate the camshaft sprocket to make sure it's flat and
can rotate on the taper freely.&nbsp; This is to let it rotate when you tension
the belt.</p>
<p>Again, the camshaft lock bar holds the camshaft in
place while the camshaft sprocket can rotate independently - this is why you need
to use the camshaft lock bar and need to loosen the sprocket!&nbsp; There is no missing key on the camshaft, the sprocket is a tapered/conical
fit to the camshaft end.&nbsp; It's also difficult to put the new belt on unless
the camshaft sprocket is off.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/timingbelt24.jpg" width="347" height="279"></p>
<p>The injection pump bolts should already be loose (3x 13mm bolts).&nbsp; Your
replacement bolts should be multiple use bolts and should not be single use stretch
bolts.&nbsp; The kits sold by the vendors linked in &quot;timing belt part
1&quot; do not use
stretch bolts.&nbsp; If they are pointed at the end
and are tapered at the neck, they are single use only bolts. (see below
illustration).&nbsp; If they are 1 use only bolts, remove them 1 at a time and
hand thread the replacements back.&nbsp; Do not tighten yet.</p>
<p>The point of loosening the 3 bolts is to fine tune the injection timing
later.&nbsp; Remember, the sprocket should rotate independently of the pump while you
tighten the tensioner.&nbsp; The lock pin only locks the injection pump
position and guarantees that the car will start and has approximate timing, you
should use
a VCDS to fine tune the injection timing after the belt is reinstalled.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/timingbelt23.JPG" width="363" height="252"></p>
<p> If you didn't double check the position of the injection
lock pin before, confirm its position now.&nbsp; Remember, the hole should be
bracketed by the slot.&nbsp; I suggest rotating the injection pump sprocket so
that the oval hole is somewhere in the middle of its play so that you have room
to adjust it later (as shown below).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pumppin.jpg" width="780" height="534"></p>
<p> The sprocket should be positioned so that the bolts and oval holes are
somewhere in the middle.&nbsp; This gives you the maximum adjustment range when
fine tuning it later.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/pinholeb.JPG" width="584" height="474"></p>
<p>Again, the camshaft and injection pump should be locked but their sprockets should be free to
rotate when you tighten the tensioner.&nbsp; Use the 2587 2 pin spanner wrench to tighten the tensioner
clockwise in the direction of
the blue arrow until the index marks (boxes pictured below) line up.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
you have an automatic transmission, the pointer should rotate into the middle of
the &quot;V&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>CAUTION</b> - Although it's possible to tighten the tensioner in a counterclockwise direction,
this is wrong, only tighten in a clockwise direction!&nbsp;&nbsp; The engine should be cold when setting the tensioner.&nbsp; It
automatically adjusts to temperature so don't be surprised if it's slightly off when later
checking it on a warm engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/timingbelt26.JPG" width="640" height="334"></p>
<p> The raised dash and the
notch highlighted below will come into alignment as you tighten the tensioner
clockwise with the spanner
wrench.&nbsp; As you turn the tensioner <u>clockwise</u>, the camshaft sprocket,
injection pump sprocket, and water pump should rotate slightly.&nbsp; This is
shown in the below videos.&nbsp; Remember, the
camshaft/pump sprocket bolts are
loose so that they can rotate and spread tension across the belt evenly.&nbsp; This is what it looks like after you tighten it - the alignment marks are
facing each other after turning the tensioner clockwise and the tensioner slot
is still in its tab.&nbsp; Remember, since you're viewing the tensioner at an
angle, beware of <a href="../multi/auto-mechanics-tips.htm#parallax">parallax</a>.&nbsp;
Use a mirror to confirm that it's at the correct position and that the tab is in
its slot.&nbsp; If it's correct, tighten the tensioner's nut (13mm) to
15 ft lbs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/tbalign1.jpg" width="673" height="580"></p>
<p>Caution: the Bentley service manual calls the tensioner nut a &quot;lock
nut&quot; in 2 places but doesn't call it a lock nut in the diagram.&nbsp; If
you want, you can put a light dab of blue/light strength threadlocker on the
stud.&nbsp; Don't get threadlocker everywhere - more is not always better.&nbsp;
Also note that threadlocker changes torque specs, refer to your product's spec
sheet for details on how to adjust the torque spec.&nbsp; I would just stick to
15 ft-lb since 1 ft-lb overtightened will not damage it
or interfere with operation of the tensioner.&nbsp; Again, this website provides
tips and an interpretation of the service manual but is not responsible for the
work that you do to your car.</p>
<p>Here is a video showing a closeup of the tensioner and a video of the
belt.&nbsp; Click the play button (the triangle that points to the right) to
view the video.&nbsp; The button to the right of &quot;HQ&quot; will switch the
video to full screen.&nbsp; Remember, it's normal for the sprockets to rotate when you tighten
the belt.&nbsp; The crankshaft sprocket should not move since you are locking
its position.</p>

<p>Tighten the 3x 13mm injection pump bolts.&nbsp; Once the tensioner is tight,
the sprockets should be in their correct position.&nbsp; You will now tighten
the rest of the sprockets.</p>
<p>Remove the camshaft lock bar but please read this note: the service
manual says to remove the camshaft lock bar before tightening the sprocket bolt
but you can tighten the bolt first and then remove the bar so that the shimmed bar holds the camshaft perfectly at TDC.&nbsp; If you remove
the lock bar before tightening the camshaft bolt, it's possible although
unlikely, that the camshaft could move a little bit when you tighten the
bolt.&nbsp; The service manual says to remove the bar first because it doesn't want you to
torque against the lock bar.&nbsp; Again, the sprocket
counterholding tool should counterhold the sprocket when tightening the camshaft
bolt.</p>
<p>Tighten the camshaft sprocket bolt to the factory value 33 ft-lbs
but see the caution below!&nbsp; Remember to counterhold the camshaft sprocket when you
tighten the bolt!</p>
<p><b>CAUTION</b> - Make sure that the tapered conical tip
of the camshaft is clean of oil or grease and dry because damage to the threads, tapered camshaft
end, or an oily tip can change the force on the taper and result in a spun
camshaft sprocket and engine damage!&nbsp; I use a slightly higher torque spec
of&nbsp;about 40 ft-lbs on the camshaft sprocket bolt.&nbsp; This is only about a
20% increase in torque over the recommended
factory value.&nbsp; The reason why is because there have been reports of spun
camshaft sprockets using 33 ft-lbs.&nbsp; Regardless of the cause (faulty torque
wrench, user error, greasy camshaft taper, etc.,), a slightly higher
value on this bolt will not damage the camshaft end, sprocket, or the 19mm
sprocket bolt, but will add a margin of safety against a spun sprocket.&nbsp; I believe that this
range is a very safe balance
between spinning the sprocket and any possible damage to the camshaft or
sprocket.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the components so you can decide for yourself:
the bolt, the camshaft threads, the camshaft taper, the sprocket, the belt
position.<br>
-The 19mm camshaft sprocket <b> bolt</b>  and threads are large compared to the low torque value of 33
    ft-lbs and will not be damaged by a small increase in torque value.&nbsp; Later BEW
    engines use a torque of 74 ft-lbs on an identical bolt.&nbsp; Although the
    camshaft, taper, and setup is different, the bolt is the same.<br>
-The camshaft <b> threads</b> are not brittle enough to be damaged by a 20%
    increase.&nbsp; It's made out of steel.&nbsp; As a matter of opinion from a
non-mechanic or engineer, I do not go over 40 although others have tested the camshaft to
well over 50 ft-lbs without any damage to the threads when using proper tools and pullers.&nbsp;
Some even recommend 45 ft-lb.&nbsp; A very high torque could cause some damage.<br>
-The <b> taper</b> is also strong and it's not likely to be damaged or
    deformed by a small increase.&nbsp; A much higher torque could deform the
    taper but a 20% increase isn't going to do any damage.&nbsp; Of course, whacking the sprocket with a
    hammer or improper removal can cause damage so always use a puller or the
    method in the factory service manual.<br>
-There have not been any reports of damage to the <b> sprocket</b> due to a
    slightly higher
    torque.<br>
-The <b> belt position</b> on the sprocket is not dictated by the sprocket and is
    unchanged.</p>
<p>In the end, the torque spec that you want to use is up to you.&nbsp;
Regardless of the cause, I would
rather err on the side of caution.&nbsp; A small
increase in torque on this bolt could prevent serious damage and won't damage
anything.&nbsp; More torque isn't better but it's
possible that the factory torque specification of 33 ft-lbs is to too low, judging from the
rare but catastrophic spun sprocket.&nbsp; Again, make sure that the taper is
clean and dry of any oil or grease.&nbsp; It's your
engine and myturbodiesel is not responsible for any damage as a result of the
information found on this website, any non factory or OEM specification or
instruction is done at your own risk, etc.,...see the full legal disclaimer in

Agreement.<br>

<p>Remove injection pump locking pin, crankshaft lock bar, and camshaft lock.&nbsp; Double check
for TDC.&nbsp; Remove tape
or plugs from intake manifold.&nbsp; If you haven't tightened all the
bolts, double check them now! </p>
<p>Install the vacuum pump with a new seal at the end of the camshaft so that oil does not get pumped
out when you rotate the engine.</p>
<h3>Final checks when installing the TDI timing belt</h3>
<p>Check that the manual transmission is in neutral gear and rotate the
engine twice by hand in running direction (clockwise).&nbsp; I suggest using the
19mm crankshaft bolt to turn the
engine over.&nbsp; Do not use the starter to rotate the engine.&nbsp; Turning by
hand checks that there is no mechanical interference, that all the small bolts
have been tightened, and is a low enough force to
not damage anything.</p>
<p>Although it's possible to use the injection pump sprocket to turn over the
engine and the sprocket has a lot of teeth engaging the timing belt, do not use
the IP sprocket.&nbsp; The reason is because it has to work against the
resistance of the valve springs and if you attached the serpentine belt, it can
cause the belt to jump the injection pump sprocket.&nbsp; Use the crankshaft bolt
to turn the engine over but if it's jammed, do not apply any significant force to it since it's a
stretch bolt.&nbsp; You can also use the camshaft sprocket on this exact engine
model.&nbsp; You should feel light resistance as the engine builds compression -
let it bleed off and then you can continue turning the engine.&nbsp; If it seems jammed, double check that the camshaft and
injection pump locks are removed and the transmission is in neutral.&nbsp; A
jammed timing belt could
also be the valves are hitting the pistons or something left somewhere which is
holding the belt.</p>
<p> If you don't know what abnormal resistance is while rotating the engine, you
could <a href="../multi/glowplugreplace.htm">remove the
glow plugs</a> so that there is no engine compression (it all leaks out the glow
plug holes).&nbsp; If you feel abnormal resistance, stop and put the engine back
at TDC.&nbsp; Reinsert the camshaft lock bar and injection pump pin.</p>
<p>After you rotate the engine through 2-4 cycles, put
the engine back at TDC and double check that the injection pump pin and camshaft
lock bar can go back in.&nbsp; If they do and the engine rotated normally, the
belt is on correctly.&nbsp; Continue with reinstallation.&nbsp; If they do not,
go back and reset them.</p>
<p>Do not rotate the engine in reverse
once the serpentine belt is attached because the various accessories are already
worn in one direction.&nbsp; It's also not great for the injection pump.&nbsp; Again, do not use the starter to force the engine
over.&nbsp; The whole point of rotating it by hand is so that you don't cause any damage
from a loose bolt, timing belt off a tooth, etc.</p>
<p>The rest of installation is the reverse of removal.&nbsp; Double check all
wires, hoses, etc.&nbsp; Make sure no paper towels are stuffed down the
piping.&nbsp; The harmonic balancer/crankshaft pulley bolts are asymmetrical and
the bolt holes will only line up 1 way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also check the length of the
new bolts against the length of the old bolts.</p>

<p>The (2x 16mm and 2x 18mm) motor mount bolts are torque to yield &quot;stretch
bolts&quot;
and should be replaced each time they are torqued to their final value.&nbsp; In
other words, do not reuse your old bolts.&nbsp; Torque specs are below.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
the aluminum motor mount strips <u>at all</u>, stop, remove the bolt, and repair
the threads with a helicoil or buy a new motor mount (VW# 038 199 207 h).</p>

<p> Leave the upper timing belt cover off so that you can
check the injection pump timing with a VCDS.&nbsp; Here is
the serpentine belt routing.<br>

 </p>

<p>Note about the single use motor mount stretch bolts: stretch bolts securely
clamp through a range of temp and vibration by deforming.&nbsp; In the event of a frontal
crash, I believe that further stress on the bolts + the design of the motor mounts should
increase the likelihood that the engine goes underneath the passenger compartment.&nbsp;
For this reason, I do not suggest adding additional bolts to hold the motor
mount up.

<h3> How to fine tune injection pump timing on TDI engine.</h3>
<p> You should now fine tune the injection timing with a Ross Tech VCDS (used to be called
VAG-COM).&nbsp;
If you don't have a VCDS but the engine starts, just try to find someone
later who has it and use their VCDS to check and fine tune the timing.&nbsp; The purpose
of the locking pin on the injection pump is to ensure that the car will
start and is set to the approximate correct timing.&nbsp; Fine tuning the injection
timing will make sure that you are maximizing power, starting, and economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If
nothing else, it's a good idea to make sure that injection pump timing is set within the normal boundaries of
the graph.&nbsp; Some screenshots from rocketeer928.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000">Caution:</font> when the engine is running, make
sure any bolts/tools/fingers are clear of all belts or radiator fans.&nbsp; The
moving belts or fan can easily rip off your hand or fingers if they get caught
in the belts or fan!&nbsp; See the TOS Agreement for the full legal disclaimer.</b></p>
<p>Start the
car and check engine oil pressure, any abnormal sounds, etc.&nbsp; Assuming the car is running OK, rev the engine at about 2,500 rpm until the
coolant temperature gauge is sitting straight up (ideally at least 85°C or 185°F).&nbsp;
You could also go for a drive until the engine is heated up.&nbsp; A warm engine
is
required to check the timing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Leave the engine running at idle.&nbsp; Connect the VCDS cable to the car’s OBD2 port and to your Windows PC.&nbsp;
Start up the VCDS software and you'll see the screen below.&nbsp; Click “Select”&nbsp;
(circled).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/ip37.jpg" width="639" height="462"></p>
<p> Click “01-Engine”.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/ip38.jpg" width="640" height="464"></p>
<p> After VCDS has established a connection with the ECU, click &quot;Basic
Settings - 04&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> You could also click “Meas. Blocks – 08” ,
then Engine Measuring Block 000 and click “Go!”.&nbsp; Then click the
“Switch to Basic Settings” button.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/IQadjust1.jpg" width="630" height="449"></p>
<p>Click the “TDI Timing” button.&nbsp; A graph like the ones below will
appear and the glowplug light on the instrument panel will flash.&nbsp; If the
graph can't show up or you don't have a genuine VCDS, look at measuring block
000 (shown below).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use data block 000, note block 2 (timing) and 9 (fuel temperature not
coolant temp).&nbsp; When block 9 is reading 110 (this is
why you must let the car warm up), then
block 2 should show 70.&nbsp; The values may not correspond to C or F.&nbsp; It
may be an internal value that the ECU translates into
temperature.&nbsp; To be sure, go to &quot;advanced measurement blocks&quot; and check off which values you want to
see, there you can see the actual temperature.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refer to the service
manual for the injection timing graph if you can't see the graph through VCDS.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/ip42.jpg" width="639" height="464"></p>
<p>From the drop down menu in the lower right corner, select either “1.9l R4
TDI AGR/AHF/AHL Golf/Jetta (pre 04/1999)” or “1.9l R4 TDI AGR/AHF/AHL/ASV
Golf/Jetta (post 03/1999)”, depending on the year of your car.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/ip43.png" width="639" height="462"></p>
<p> The horizontal and vertical yellow lines apex is where the timing is set.&nbsp;
Below is the position that the timing happened to land on.&nbsp; Below the blue
line is retarded and above the green line is advanced.&nbsp; An acceptable range is between the
lower red and upper green diagonal lines.</p>
<p>If there are no yellow lines, timing is very retarded.&nbsp; If there's only a vertical yellow line timing is
too advanced (pictured below).<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/ip44.png" width="639" height="462"></p>
<p>
To adjust injection pump timing you must physically adjust the injection pump.&nbsp;
Adjusting the injection pump will change block 2 (the horizontal line if you're
looking at the chart).&nbsp; Always keep the injection pump timing within the boundaries of the timing
chart on VCDS.&nbsp; Slightly advanced timing (above the center line) will
result in slightly higher EGT and slightly more engine stress but better fuel economy,
power, and easier cold starts.&nbsp; Slightly advanced timing is preferable to slightly retarded
timing although anywhere within the boundaries of the lines on the chart is considered
acceptable.</p>
<p>The picture shows timing that is considered acceptable.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/TB_head_rem/ip45.png" width="639" height="462"></p>
<p>To adjust injection pump timing, first shut off the engine.&nbsp; Take off the upper timing belt cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slightly loosen the 3x 13mm injection pump sprocket bolts.&nbsp; Only loosen them enough so that
the sprocket can slide under their pressure - if you loosen them fully, the
injection pump may move independently of the sprocket due to pressure from the
belt and internal forces.&nbsp; A tip is to loosen
them one at a time and then tighten it just barely with a ratchet.&nbsp; If you
loosen them all too much, the sprocket is too free to move and timing may go
from way retarded to way advanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then use a wrench to gently nudge the 22mm center nut that is connected to the injection
pump shaft.&nbsp; Rotating the nut counterclockwise
will decrease the block 2 value and retard timing, clockwise will increase block 2
value and advance injection timing.&nbsp;
Refer to your service manual for the exact graph of the injection pump timing
envelope for your car.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not apply
too much pressure to the center injection pump sprocket nut because it's not
designed to be removed and you don't want to loosen it!&nbsp; Then torque the 3x
13&nbsp; bolts to their final torque of 18 ft lbs&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that the service manual says to rotate the injection pump <i>shaft/nut</i>
clockwise to advance timing, counterclockwise to retard timing.&nbsp; Remember
that when you move the pulley or shaft in one direction, the relative motion of
the shaft is in the other direction.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Recheck timing by following the earlier steps.&nbsp; Obviously, when you are adjusting the 3 bolts or injection
pump pulley, the engine must be off! </p>

<p>It took rocketeer928 three adjustments to get the timing slightly advanced, as he prefers it
(pic from rocketeer928).&nbsp; Reinstall the upper timing belt cover when satisfied.<br>
