<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>

<h2>This article shows how to remove the aluminum oil pan and install a hybrid steel/aluminum oil pan on a VW or Audi TDI engine.</h2>

<p>NOTE: This article is for the mk4 Jetta, Golf, and New Beetle. For the B5 Passat, see <a href="../b5/oil-pump-passat-tdi-replacement.htm">1000q: oil chain removal/oil pan removal</a> - the front subframe has to be lowered and supported for clearance.</p>
<p>The aluminum oil pan is easily cracked if car bottoms out in a pothole, is hit by a rock, you run over a  road alligator (shredded and blown out truck tires), or hits other road hazards. This article shows installation of a hybrid steel bottomed/aluminum oil pan that is more durable.</p>
<p>However, any good hit will crack the aluminum sides of the oil pan vs. a metal skidplate which transfers the impact to the body through the supports. To decrease the liklihood of cracking the oil pan, refresh the suspension if it's worn out (many years of weight sitting on the springs causes them to sag and the bushings to compress) and get a metal skidplate to replace the plastic water shield. Dieselgeek.com makes a good skidplate, refer to <a href="Skid-plate-install.htm">1000q: metal skidplate installation</a> for more tips and notes.</p>
<p>If you need to replace the front or rearl main seal, see <a href="crankshaft-front-seal-replacement-tdi.htm">1000q: mk4 front seal replacement</a> or  <a href="Rear-main-seal-replacement-TDI.htm">1000q: mk4 rear main seal replacement</a></p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<p>First drain the oil: see <a href="oil-change-Jetta-TDI-engine.htm">1000q: mk4 oil change</a> for tips. If you spill some oil on the ground, first wipe it up with towels.&nbsp; Then
pour some driveway spill absorber or basic kitty litter on the spill.&nbsp; Step
and grind the litter into a dust and let it sit for a while.&nbsp; It needs time
to soak up the stain.&nbsp; When it's saturated, sweep up the gravel/dust.&nbsp;
Do not dump old engine oil onto
the ground or into the water!&nbsp; If you can't find a dump for used
coolant/antifreeze, engine oil, gear oil, or other car fluids, the website <a href="http://earth911.com/">earth911.com</a>
can search for a local waste disposal.</p>
<p>If the car is not yet in the air, engage the parking brake, jack up the front of the car using the factory jack
  points, rest car securely on jack stands, chock the rear wheels, and make sure
  the car is safe and secure before doing anything else.&nbsp; I use <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">wood
    blocks that I made to help support the car</a> but always place jack stands at
  the factory hack points before getting under the car.&nbsp; See the TOS
  Agreement for the full legal disclaimer.&nbsp; See <a href="jackpoints.htm">1000q:
    jack stand points</a> to see where the points were on my car.

<p>The following tips and pictures are from user Richard55, thank you for your contribution!</p>
<p>Remove the right wheel.</p>
<p>Remove the two A/C mounting bolts and pry the a/c pump toward the front of the car.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-1.jpg" width="900" height="675">  <br>
  <br>
Next the three bellhousing bolts on the drivers side of the oil pan.<br>
<img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-2.jpg" width="900" height="675"></p>
<p>Note: 2004-2006 models  use 12 point triple square spline bits but it's tight. The size is M12, you can find these at any autozone/napa/advance. A T55 torx (6 point) will also fit in an emergency but beware stripped bolts...<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-10.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="600"><br>
  <br>
  Break loose all the 10mm bolts that hold the pan on, don't for get   the four hidden ones inside the bellhousing on the drivers side and the   ones at the passengers end of the pan.  I broke them all loose and got   out the trusty drill with the 1/4" adaptor and go to town.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-3.jpg" width="900" height="675">  <br>
  <br>
  After they are all out, gently pry the pan off the block, slow and easy it will come off. Editors note: you can tap the pan with a rubber mallet or hammer and piece of wood to shock  and loosen the seal. I do not suggest prying on the gasket surfaces with anything sharp.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-4.jpg" width="900" height="675">  <br>
  <br>
  It's off and here are the guts.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-5.jpg" width="900" height="675">  <br>
  <br>
  Chain, oil pump, and sprokets all in great shape.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-6.jpg" width="900" height="675"></p>
<p>  Two 10mm bolts and R&amp;I with a new oil pickup tube.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-7.jpg" width="900" height="675">  <br>
  <br>
    Clean off all the old RTV and grease/oil. Take your time and get it all off, and install the new pan. The bead of liquid gasketmaker should to the inner side of the boltholes to prevent oil leaks.<br>

<p><img src="../../images/a4/tdi-oil-pan-9.jpg" width="900" height="675"><br>
  <br>
Check pan to a/c pump clearance and if good you are done.  If not   loosen the a/c pump and file off until you have enough clearance. <br>

<p>Another fine job complete.  lol</p>
