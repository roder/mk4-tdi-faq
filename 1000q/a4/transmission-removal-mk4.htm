<h2>This article has tips on how to remove and replace the manual transmission in the
mk4 Jetta Golf New Beetle TDI with ALH engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p> The New Beetle transmission has slightly
different gearing from the Jetta and Golf.&nbsp; BEW engine transmission removal
should be about the same.&nbsp; There may be small changes to the part numbers
over the years such as oil seals so verify all part numbers with your
vendor.&nbsp; You have to
remove the transmission if you want to replace the rear main oil seal, see <a href="Rear-main-seal-replacement-TDI.htm">1000q:
rear main oil seal</a> for more details.&nbsp; If you want to
replace the 5th gear with a taller gear to improve mileage and lower rpms/noise,
this would be a good time to do it, see <a href="../multi/5th-gear-swap-VW.htm">1000q:
5th gear swap</a> for more details.&nbsp; It's also a good time to change the
manual transmission gear oil, see <a href="manual-transmission-gear-oil-change-Jetta-Golf.htm">1000q:
manual trans gear oil</a>.&nbsp; This article is not a substitute for the factory service
manual, refer to your factory service manual for the official instructions.&nbsp;
Observe all cautions in the factory service manual and see the TOS Agreement for the
full legal disclaimer.</p>
<p>An engine support is required because you will be removing the transmission
mount and dogbone pendulum mount.&nbsp; It's also a good time to replace the CV boots if
your car has very high miles.&nbsp; I don't suggest buying replacement axles
despite their low price just for the new boot because genuine VW axles are
better quality and better balanced than most of the axles you'll find at the
local parts store.</p>

dimensions if you order a seal at the local parts store!&nbsp; The seal is 62mm outer diameter, 48mm

<h3>Procedure summary: there are 3 basic steps: remove the battery box, shifter cables, starter, clutch slave cylinder,
and 2 sensors.&nbsp; Support the engine, remove the transmission mount, and remove.&nbsp; Detailed steps
below, pics were taken at various steps for illustration.</h3>
<p>Raise the front of the car and securely rest it on jack stands.&nbsp; See <a href="jackpoints.htm">1000q:
mk4 Jetta jack points</a> for the jack locations that were on my car and <a href="../multi/wood-block.htm">1000q:
wood blocks</a> for an additional support for the car. Using wood blocks gave me a little more clearance under the
car for the transmission jack.&nbsp; You will be shaking the car a bit so make
sure the car is stable and secure on level, solid ground.&nbsp; Chock the wheels
and apply the parking brake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the battery and air intake box/accordion hose.&nbsp; Set the battery
aside, don't bother putting it on wood since it doesn't make a difference in
discharging.&nbsp; Don't open the intake box unless you are going to change the
filter because it will break the foam seal.&nbsp; Just remove the 2x 10mm bolts
holding it down and remove as a unit.&nbsp; Unclamp the accordion hose and set
aside.&nbsp; Tape over the intake hose - this will create a good seal against
dropped nuts and loose flying springs entering the intake tract.&nbsp; I avoid
using paper towels since they tend to get stuffed down and forgotten.&nbsp; Hose clamp pliers like the ones pictured above do a much better
job or removing spring hose clamps than regular pliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Optional step</u>:&nbsp; If you are going to be doing a 5th gear swap
while the transmission is out, remove the transmission end cover and get the large torx bolts
loose now.&nbsp; You can step on the brakes and put the car in gear to hold
those torx bolts.&nbsp; Once the transmission is out, it'll be much harder to
counterhold the bolts.&nbsp; See <a href="../multi/5th-gear-swap-VW.htm">1000q: 5th
gear swap</a> for more details.</p>
<p>Unplug the reverse gear sensor (on the shifter assembly above the starter,
white arrow below).&nbsp; Remove the shifter cable ends (highlighted in green above) by lifting the center of
the spring-lock and sliding it off.&nbsp; Push the shifter assembly on top of
the transmission down and rotate the black pin on the left side straight
up.&nbsp; This will lock the shifter.&nbsp; Remove the nut on top of the
transmission holding the weight down.</p>
<p>Also remove the wiring harness above
the starter.&nbsp; First remove the wires.&nbsp; You may be able to unclip and
slide it off the metal part as shown below.<br>

<p>Also remove the speedometer
sensor (look on top of the differential, yellow arrow in the below picture).&nbsp;
Ignore the blue arrows on the transmission brace bracket in the below picture for now.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/drvlne/trans2.jpg" width="651" height="720"></p>
<p>Unbolt the shifter cable bracket (3x 13mm, yellow arrows below) and the clutch slave
cylinder (2x 13mm, yellow arrows in next picture)&nbsp; Carefully tie them up and away to the side.&nbsp; The
clutch hydraulic line has a plastic clip where the rubber transitions to
metal.&nbsp; Make sure to not bend the metal line.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/drvlne/trans3.jpg" width="779" height="540"></p>
<p> Do not press the clutch pedal while the slave cylinder isn't
attached to the transmission or else it will shoot the rod out.&nbsp; Now you
should have room to remove the
bracket from the transmission to the transmission mount (yours should be a black tube, pictured
earlier with blue arrows).&nbsp; Do not remove the 2
large 18mm transmission mount bolts (red x) because they are holding the
transmission up.&nbsp; Note the little ledge on the mount for proper alignment
during installation.<br>

<p>Disconnect the power steering metal cooling loop on the driver's side and the
front of the transmission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go under the car and remove the CV boot shield (shown below) and driver's
side plastic side splash shield (pass side pictured).&nbsp; Stick a screwdriver
in the metal speed nut slots to quickly spin them off.....</p>
