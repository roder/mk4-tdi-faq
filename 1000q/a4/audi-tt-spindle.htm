<h2>The Audi TT/VW used sportier suspension pieces than the Jetta/Golf/New
Beetle (A4) TDI.&nbsp; This shows how to convert to the Audi TT suspension.</h2>

<p>In my opinion, if you just want big brakes for your TDI, stay
with the 1.8T/VR6 spindle.&nbsp; Remember, it's not necessary to use the TT/R32 <u>
spindle</u> to use the TT/R32 <u>brakes</u>, the brakes will bolt onto the 1.8T/VR6 spindle
but not your TDI spindle.&nbsp; There are two levels of conversion:&nbsp; spindle and
ball joint alone <b>OR</b> spindle, lower control arm (LCA), front sway
bar, and ball joints.&nbsp; Below is a picture of a TT spindle vs. the 1.8T/VR6 spindle.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of using the more complex TT/R32 conversion is adjustable
camber on the TT lower control arm (LCA).&nbsp;&nbsp; You could use a camber
plate or a LCA
mod kit if you just need adjustable camber.&nbsp; The Audi TT LCA has
larger and stiffer front and rear suspension bushings which will improve
handling.&nbsp; (The large bushing will also fit in all mk3/mk4 LCA).&nbsp; Using the TT spindle alone does not give you adjustable camber, you have to
convert to the TT LCA because that's where camber is adjusted from.&nbsp; Some other differences:&nbsp;TT/R32 LCA are
cast metal vs. the stamped steel of the
1.8T/VR6.&nbsp; The solid part is stronger but it's also heavier (about 5 lbs more each).&nbsp;&nbsp;Pictured below is an Audi
TT LCA and a closeup with measurements showing the elongated holes for adjustable
camber.&nbsp; Also note the nub on the LCA.&nbsp; You may need this nub for the
sway bar links, some don't have the nub.&nbsp; I've heard that 2001 cast arms
have this nub but others have said they don't.&nbsp; The problem is that non-nub
arms have the same part number as arms with the nub.&nbsp; More on this below.</p>

<p>Below is what the TDI A4 body control arm looks like.&nbsp; It's stamped
steel and the rear bushing has spaces vs. the solid bushing above to allow more
compliance.<br>

note that there are 2 versions of the Audi TT LCA, pictured below.&nbsp; The
early style has smaller bushings and is only available used, the new style has
larger bushings (bushings are direct fit into all mk3 and mk4 TDI). Also make
sure your LCA has the nubs for drilling a spot to attach the sway bar endlinks
(more details below)<br>

<h3>Detailed procedure below</h3>

<p><b>
Summary here</b></p>

<p>The parts list above has a few combinations that you can mix-match, read this
page and then figure out what you need.&nbsp; Your two choices are: spindle/ball joint conversion
<b> OR</b> spindle/ball
joint/LCA/sway
bar conversion.&nbsp; To use the TT/R32 spindle, modify the TT ball joints
yourself to fit the existing TDI lower control arms, the rest is direct bolt
on.&nbsp; You also have to turn the tie rod ends upside down.&nbsp; You do not
get adjustable camber.&nbsp; To use the TT/R32 spindle/ball joint/LCA/front
sway bar, you have to modify the lower control arms to accept the TDI sway bar end
links, the
rest is bolt on.&nbsp; You do get adjustable camber.&nbsp; Original threads can be viewed here: http://www.myturbodiesel.com/forum/f5/nb-build-out-atl-ga-panama-central-america-trip-2268, &nbsp;http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?id=1254442, http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?id=1724405,
http://forums.vwvortex.com/zerothread?id=2062529 .&nbsp;  I've basically summarized
and organized all the most important info from many forum posts on this page.&nbsp;

<p>Also note that the Audi TT had two versions of the LCA, there was a recall to
make the TT more stable and give it more understeer.&nbsp; The specific modifications consisted of new front lower control arms with larger, softer, offset front bushings, as well as modified front and rear shocks with stiffer compression and softer rebound dampening to reduce weight transfer from rear to front when braking. The front sway bar was increased in size from 19mm to 20 mm, while the rear was reduced 1mm in diameter from 15mm to 14mm. The result in handling was slower steering response, increased understeer, and reduced lift-off
oversteer.</p>

<h3><b>To use the Audi spindle/ball joint only</b></h3>

<p>Other than turning the tie rod end upside down to fit the spindle, the only
other modification you need is to grind/drill the Audi TT ball joint to fit the
A4's LCA.&nbsp; It's not possible to drill out the LCA for adjustable camber because it's stamped steel and doing so would weaken it.&nbsp; The Audi TT LCA
is cast so it can withstand the elongated holes for adjustable camber.&nbsp; The
spindle also has a better camber curve.</p>

<p>Below is the TT spindle with an A4 LCA.&nbsp; Note that the LCA is stamped
steel.<br>

<h3>To use the Audi TT spindle/ball joint/LCA/front sway bar conversion</h3>

<p>The biggest obstacle is finding a place to mount your stock sway bar end
links if you choose to keep the stock front swaybar.&nbsp; Some Audi TT/R32 LCA have the nub for drilling out a
spot to mount your current sway bar end links, some do not.&nbsp; If you do not
want to keep the stock front swaybar or your <span class="posttext">TT/R32 LCA
do not have the nubs,</span>, you have to get a TT front swaybar, TT front
swaybar endlinks, and new TT struts.&nbsp; <span class="posttext">The 1.8T/VR6
sway bar goes over the axle, the TT/R32 swaybar is less likely to have no clearance
issues since it goes under the axle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="posttext">Remember, if your LCA does not have the nub, you must
get TT/R32 struts to connect the swaybar endlinks.&nbsp; If it does, you can
drill the LCA out and reuse the stock swaybar endlinks.&nbsp; This is pictured
below and in a picture above.</span></p>

<p>Also note that there are several different bearings for the
Audi TT spindle. The bearings have different part numbers, and cars that came
with an 18 inch wheel package from the factory will have the appropriate bearing
for the 20ths. If getting TT spindles, your best bet is to find R32 spindles if
you don't want to replace wheel bearings or modify the axle bolt from the
1.8T/VR6 spindle.</p>

<p>Below is a modified Audi TT LCA with drilled out hole.&nbsp; Note the nub which the swaybar endlink is bolted to.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/a4/BBsus/Finishedarm2.jpg" width="640" height="480"></p>
<p><strong>Procedure and pics below from Richard55 at myturbodiesel.com</strong></p>
<p>Put the LCA in a vice as we are going to drill it out to 10mmx1.5 pitch.  Center punch the LCA in the center of the knub.<br>
  <img src="../../images/a4/BBsus/lca-1.jpg" width="900" height="675">  <br>
</p>
<p>Before you drill figure out how deep you need to go by installing the bolt into the old LCA with the sway bar bracket in place. Then use tape to mark the depth. You will need to go a bit deeper to get it to fit correctly. If you don't go deep enough the bolt will not bottom out on the bracket and it will be loose, but don't worry too much you can always trim the bolt some to fit. I had to lol.<br>
<img src="../../images/a4/BBsus/lca2.jpg" width="720" height="590"></p>
<p>Start small, keeping it straight and work your way up to the tapping bit size.<br>
<img src="../../images/a4/BBsus/lca-3.jpg" width="900" height="675"></p>
<p>Again mark the depth you need to go on the tapping drill. Go for it, just keep it straight and not wobbleing side to side. <br>
<img src="../../images/a4/BBsus/lca-4.jpg" width="900" height="675"></p>
<p>Tap the hole, install the LCA on the car and install the sway bar. Done Audi TT LCA now works with the NB sway bar.<br>
