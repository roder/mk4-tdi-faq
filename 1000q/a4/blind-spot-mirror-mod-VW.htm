<h1>Regular and Aspheric blind spot mirror installation for mk4 VW</h1>
<p>

<p><b><font size="4">Introduction</font></b></p>
<p>Related links: <a href="../a5/blind-spot-mirror.htm"> 1000q: blind spot mirror installation for mk5</a> 2005.5+ cars
and mk4 VW Passat that used the rounder mirrors.</p>
<p>This article shows how to replace your mirror with a flat, convex, or
aspheric mirror on all mk4 VW.&nbsp; This includes all 4th generation Jetta,
Passat, New Beetle, and Golf.&nbsp; In the US/Canada market, the regular mirror on the
driver's side is flat.&nbsp; The regular mirror on the passenger side is convex,
or curved outward, and says &quot;Objects may appear closer etc..&quot;&nbsp; An aspheric mirror is a mirror that is curved
out to show
more of the car's blind spot.&nbsp; The
difference is that it's
much more convex than even your existing passenger side mirror and has a super wide
angle outer third section.&nbsp; The advantages are a cleaner look than using a
stick on mirror and you also keep the heated mirror function.&nbsp; See below
for model and year changes and mirror compatibility/part numbers.&nbsp; These
are all genuine VW parts that are put on cars from foreign markets where they
drive on the other side of the road or have an optional <img border="0" src="../../images/misc/mir/vw36.jpg" width="404" height="341" align="right"> aspheric mirror.</p>
<p><b>Objects
look farther due to convex and the super wide outer section</b></p>
<p>You can replace the driver's side mirror with a flat section with no curve, a
convex mirror with a medium curve, or a super wide curve aspheric.&nbsp; Most
vendors stock only flat and aspheric mirrors.&nbsp; If you don't want a super
wide angle on the driver's side, you could use a convex mirror on
the driver's side, making it like the passenger side mirror.&nbsp; You can also
order any of these mirrors in blue tint to reduce how much light is
reflected.&nbsp; If you have tinted windows, I would stay with non tinted
mirrors since the windows will already block some light.</p>
<p>The Porsche website http://www.toolworks.com/bilofsky/boxster/mirrors.html
had some good pictures of the difference in field of view.&nbsp; VW/Audi/Porsche
all use the same type of power mirror but your specific part may vary
slightly.&nbsp; The standard flat driver's side US mirror has a field of view of
about 18<sup>o</sup>, the Euro-code driver's side mirror has a field of view of
about 20<sup>o</sup> in the convex section, 18<sup>o</sup> in the super wide
outer third, for a total of about 40<sup>o</sup> field of view.<br>

<b>
Driver's side US flat mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Driver's side Euro aspheric mirror&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Objects are closer then they appear when you switch to a convex or aspheric
mirror on the driver's side, much like
your passenger side mirror.&nbsp; The mirror comes stock on Euro cars and
directly snaps onto your existing mirror housing.&nbsp; Because they are
Euro-code mirrors instead of DOT approved mirrors, it is possible that your car may
not pass your local inspection if required.&nbsp; They don't have the
&quot;objects are closer&quot; warning as your existing passenger side mirror,
as required by DOT regulations.&nbsp; Because it may be harder to judge distance
and are not a DOT approved part, this modification is done at your own risk.&nbsp;
Most people report a positive experience using the mirrors but a few people say
that they can't get used to the wide view.</p>
<p>Note: a VW quirk is that the center position of the power mirror switch is
&quot;heat&quot;, not &quot;off&quot;.&nbsp; If you leave it to the middle
position of &quot;heat&quot;, your existing heated mirror may already be burnt
out.&nbsp; I suggest leaving the switch to &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;
to avoid this.&nbsp; This is an opportunity to restore the heated defog mirror
function when you add the blind spot mirror.&nbsp; You can also buy a
replacement Euro-code side view mirror switch that has [left, right, heat, off]
positions.&nbsp; I would rather save the money and leave the switch to
&quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;.&nbsp; Part number for the euro switch is
below.</p>
<p><b>Year/model changes and compatibility</b></p>
<p>Since the procedure is almost identical for all mk4 and mk5 cars, I have put
all the part numbers on one page.</p>
<p>All mk4 Jetta/Golf used the same mirror and housing.</p>
<p>The mk4 B5 Passat also used the same Jetta/Golf driver's side mirror glass
1998-2003 but had
a passenger side stubby mirror 1998-1999.&nbsp; Then it used the Jetta/Golf
glass 1999-2003.&nbsp; There was a lot of model year overlap in 1999 for Passat
pass. side stubby mirrors because they used them until they ran out.&nbsp; In
about 2004, the B5.5 Passat used completely new mirror housings with integrated turn
signals, these housing and mirrors are not compatible with any 1998-2003
mirror.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 2004+ part on the B5.5 Passat is the same mirror glass as the B6 passat and mk5
Jetta/Golf.&nbsp; All mk5 jetta/Golf/Passat mirrors are the same but the Jetta/Golf
uses a different plastic mirror housing than the Passat.</p>
<p>New beetle parts are not interchangeable with other VW parts.&nbsp; 1998-2000
used a different mirror glass and housing than 2001-2006 NB, early vs. late vin
is indicated below in the parts list.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Procedure</h3>
<p>Remove the plastic side mirror housing (preferred).&nbsp; There are a few
variations on the housing, so take a look at your car first to see which method
applies.&nbsp; Look underneath the housing.&nbsp; There may be a few screws and
a plastic plug covering an access hole.&nbsp; Remove these.&nbsp; The plastic
mirror housing should come up and off, giving you access to the mirror
clips.&nbsp; This is the best way to safely remove the mirror.&nbsp; Remove the
clips holding the mirror (see pics below) and remove the heater wires.</p>
<p>If your car is relatively new and it's warm, the plastic should still be
flexible and you should be able to just pull the mirror off without
damage.&nbsp; My car's plastic housing was held by torx screws that were
under the mirror so I had to pry the mirror off.&nbsp; Warning: when I did this,
it broke a few clips.&nbsp; Age, temperature, etc. can make the plastic
brittle.&nbsp; I could repair it with JB weld in my case, your damage may not be
repairable.&nbsp; To pry it off, adjust the mirror all the way inboard so that
you can reach under the far edge.&nbsp; Wear gloves and your fingers or use an allen
wrench as a pry bar.&nbsp; Pry
away at the ends while pushing in at the middle, try to pop the mirror off it's
mounts.&nbsp; The mirror is flexible and shouldn't break but be careful.&nbsp; See below for detailed pictures.&nbsp;
Then remove the mirror
heater wires.</p>
<p>There are two ways the mirror can come off.&nbsp; It can pop off the black
plastic holding tabs or pop off the white plastic actuator.&nbsp; Try to pop off
the black tabs because it's less likely to break.&nbsp; The ring below snaps
onto the mirror at 8 spots.&nbsp; The inner diameter of the ring has 6 post
holes which the white plastic actuator fits into, only 4 of them are used.&nbsp;
Below are two pictures where they are separate or assembled.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/mir/mirrorback.jpg" width="800" height="290"> </p>
<p><img border="0" src="../../images/misc/mir/mirrorback2.jpg" width="540" height="334"></p>
<p>The two white plastic balls fit into two of the post holes, the white lever
is freewheeling on the other two.&nbsp; Two are unused.&nbsp; If possible, try
to remove the mirror with the ring still attached to the motor because the white
plastic bits can be fragile.&nbsp; Mine broke so I glued it with JB weld.&nbsp;
The picture below is of a mk4 car, mk5 and B5.5 mk4 passats used a slightly different
motor but the procedure is identical.<br>
<img border="0" src="../../images/misc/mir/jbweld.jpg" width="800" height="600"></p>
<p>In the picture below, one of the white plastic balls is broken off.&nbsp; Note
the rubber boot - it should be snug against the rotating parts.&nbsp; If your
assembly is broken and cannot be repaired, the balls/motor assembly is only
available as 1 piece, VW part number 4a0 959 577.<br>

goes where.</p>
